I can do posts as well as pages, and the way things are currently set up they get displayed quite differently. I can't decide whether that's worth anything!

Anyway this is an example of a blog post. With nothing in it. Sorry about that.

If you're looking for content though, how about you go and read some stuff about getting Jekyll working: 

- [Jekyll How-to page on file locations](/pages/coding/webdev/jekyll/How-to-do-Jekyll-(File-Locations))
- [Jekyll How-to page on front matter](/pages/coding/webdev/jekyll/How-to-do-Jekyll-(Front-Matter))
- [Jekyll How-to page on misc stuff](/pages/coding/webdev/jekyll/How-to-do-Jekyll-(Misc))
- [Jekyll Troubleshooting](/pages/coding/webdev/jekyll/Jekyll-Troubleshooting)
- [Simple Jekyll Search plugin](/pages/coding/webdev/jekyll/Simple-Jekyll-Search)
