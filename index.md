I write notes constantly, but up to now I haven't come up with a consistent way of making those notres sharable and discoverable.

The hope is that any notes I write that don't have security implications can come straight here, where they'll be easily organised and discoverable for my own use, but also sharable when relevant.

This is not a blog, and not a comprehensive or well-designed wiki. It really is just my notes, which means it will be very sketchy and I make no apologies for that. But there will hopefully be some useful nuggets in here, both for me and the world at large (or some very small pocket of it).

Most of the content is (at the time of writing) listed over on the right, and the search input gives access to a full text search across all content.

The site is based on [a template built by the peops at Ably](https://github.com/ably/wiki-site), which I discovered via [this blog post](https://www.ably.io/blog/hacking-github-to-build-your-own-wiki). It's using Jekyll, Sinatra and Auth0 - and it's deployed using Heroku.
