# Speaker notes

·     Notes for me:

o   ! Check Sessionize for AOTB ’25 submission, where I added a bit describing each of the illustrated team members

o   Each child gets shown twice:

§  On both repetitions they are still for one second, then in motion

§  Introduce the child – watch in silence first time

§  Second time, talk them through it

·       Say to them:

o   First time I saw it

§  Accompanied by note to watch each child

§  Impossible to focus on all of them at once

§  Watched it several times

o   Will play several times

§  Each time focus on different child

§  Really an excuse to play funny video

§  To justify it, going to attempt to draw analogies between each individual toddler and world of software development

§  Might have got carried away with my newfound video editing skills - by the we reach the end you will know this video very well!

## Stripey blue

·       Child:

o   Wrong lane

o   In another kid’s way

o   Oblivious

·       Team member:

o   This is what happens when you don’t ask for feedback

## Green

·       Child:

o   Don’t complain, let the other kid get in the way

o   Obstacle? Nah. Go round it.

·       Team member:

o   There are things getting in the way of me doing a good job

o   But I won’t make a fuss

o   And that obstacle there? I can just go round it

o   This is what happens when we don’t empower or motivate people to make change – so they just put up with everything, find workarounds, stay quiet

## Left Red

·       Child:

o   Tries really hard

o   Falls over

o   We never discover if they made it

·       Team member

o   They kept trying

o   They didn’t give up

o   Not fast, but determined to solve the problem

o   I approve

## Left black

·       Child:

o   Sees an obstacle, goes round it

o   Then thinks again

o   Maybe that isn’t what I was supposed to do?

o   Goes back, tries again

o   Uses innovative technique

·       Team member:

o   Were in a rush

o   Then stopped, reconsidered

o   Maybe I should do that properly

o   Ooh look, I could do it like this!

o   This is another good approach – I like this

## Right red

·       Child:

o   Running is hard

o   Sometimes you fall over

o   By the time you’ve managed to get up again you just need to catch up

·       Team member:

o   We’ve all had days like these

o   This team member needs to take a day off and go back to bed

## Right black

·       Child:

o   All I have to say is that they have a stylish technique

o   They’re just getting on with what they need to do

·       Team member:

o   Good for you!

## First white left

·       Child:

o   Might be my favourite

o   Just moves hurdle out of the way

o   Why is it even there?

o   What is this nonsense?

o   This hurdle seems entirely unnecessary

·       Team member

o   Question everything!

o   Sometimes we’re trying to solve problems that don’t even need to be solved!

## Second white left

·       Child:

o   Appears late but goes rushing off into the distance

o   Wrong lane but not in anyone’s way

·       Team member:

o   We don’t really know what they were doing before they appeared

o   They seem to know what they’re doing?

o   Maybe we should check in with them, see how they’re doing

o   When we’re busy filming other toddlers it’s easy to let some people fall off our radar

## Which child is you?
