## GitHub Repos 

Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

- [Async-experiments](https://github.com/claresudbery/Async-experiments)
- [TimeTravelHack (Hack Mcr 2018)](https://github.com/claresudbery/TimeTravelHack.git) 
- [TimeTravelHackPOC (Hack Mcr 2018) (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/TimeTravelHackPOC.git)

## Docs and Blog Posts
- InSimpleTerms: Check the C# label (there are quite a few blog posts, but they're pretty much copies of what's in the word doc below)
- My notes: 
    - DotNetCoreMVC.docx in Google Drive / Clients / SMBC / Workshops / DotNetCore
