## GitHub Repos 

Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

- [Root-Scripts (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/Root-Scripts)
    - My own root scripts, installed on all machines I use.
- [Infra-Scripts (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/Infra-Scripts)
    - Useful command-line scripts and infrastructure stuff (eg Terraform, Kubernetes, GCP) from various projects
- [standards-translation (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/standards-translation)
- [data-engineering (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/data-engineering.git)
    - Stuff learnt / played with during TW data engineering course.
