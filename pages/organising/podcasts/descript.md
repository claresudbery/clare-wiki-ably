## Overview

Allows you to edit a transcript and then apply the changes to the audio / video

## Recommendations

"I was interviewing a new guest yesterday and she told me about a tool she uses which sounds fascinating and I thought I'd tell you about it in case you'd like to try it out and see if you can make use of it.

This was Aino Vonge Corry, who does a lot of writing, and the way she does it is by transcribing audio files - I think she must use something like a dictaphone.

Anyway, she told me about a site called descript.com (https://www.descript.com/). The way it works is that you give it an audio recording, and like the service I use, temi.com, it converts it into a transcript. But this goes one step further: If you then edit the transcript, it will apply your edits back onto the actual audio file! So if you cross out a bunch of text, it will remove that section of audio for you."

Ted Young also swears by it for video editing.
