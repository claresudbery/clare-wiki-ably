## Useful actions

### Actions useful for podcast editing

- See [the podcast editing page](/pages/organising/podcasts/Podcast-Editing).

### Time Shift tool

- Allows you to move clips around - will remove space between clips
- The button on the tool bar that's a double-headed arrow - also available by pressing F5

### Creating a new blank track

- Tracks | Add new

### Adding markers / labels

- Ctrl + B
    - You can label either sections or points in time, depending on whether you've selected a selection or not
    - Labels will appear in their own separate track
- To remove a label: 
    - click in the label text
    - Home
    - Shift + end
    - Delete
    - Delete again

### Zooming in and out

- Zoom tool
    - Click the magnifying glass cursor next to the time shift and selection tools
    - Then click the area you want to zoom - each click zooms you in
        - left click zooms in
        - right click zooms out
        - (it can be slow to respond - so do one click, then wait for a reponse, then another click))
- Ctrl key + mouse wheel
    - !! Watch out! Everything can  disappear or go weird if you don't act carefully
    - (I think this is because when dealing with large files, it's slow to respond - so you overdo an action because you don't see a response)
    - Start by placing the cursor to the left of the area you want to zoom in on
    - Move the mouse wheel very slowly, one click at a time

### Navigating

- [More detail here](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/navigation_tips.html)
- There's a very faint horizontal scroll bar at the bottom - easy to miss
- You can use the home and end keys to go to start and end of track
- You can use left/right keys to move left and right 
    - the granularity of this can be set up in Edit | Preferences | Playback
    - you want to change the "seek period"
- Alt + left/right moves you between labels
- You can use the selection toolbar at the bottom to go to a particular time stamp
    - Ctrl + F6 takes focus here
        - use tab to move between controls
        - use left/right to move to the value you want to change, then just type
    - !! Watch out! The "Audio position" box doesn't do what you think - even though it seems editable, it's actually for display only
        - If you want to change your position, use "Start and end of selection"
        - If you just want to go to a particular point, set Start and End to the same point or use Start and Length and set length to 0

### Using copy/paste when naming files in Audacity on Macbook

- For some reason I can't use Cmd+C and Cmd+V when naming files in the Export and Save dialogs on the Macbook, but there is a simple workaround: Use right-click | Copy and then right-click | Paste.
- I found others complaining about this on the internet, bit the right-click solution was the only suggestion that worked for me.
