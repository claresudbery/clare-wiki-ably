### RODE mic (RODE Podcaster)

I had some trouble setting it up. Message sent via support form on RODE website 18/10/22 (giving them SSE gmail address):

I have a new RODE podcaster mic. I am using it with Windows 10, attached via USB cable.
I am not using the headphone jack on the mic. I have a separate pair of headphones also attached to my laptop via USB.
But by default, every time I join a video call, my computer is selecting the RODE mic as both microphone (input) AND headphones (output).
This is my second RODE mic. It is a replacement for another mic which was exactly the same product. This didn't happen with the previous mic.
I feel like there must be some button I can press or setting I can change to stop this happening, as this didn't happen with the previous mic. 
Can you help?
(see below for response)

Notes from me:
- Maybe it only happens when my headphones are disconnected?
- Maybe some USB inputs on my laptop are treated as input as well as output?
- I checked the device manager - under sound - then right-click RODE and choose properties - and there was an event with a "device not migrated" error. I started following advice [in this article](https://www.minitool.com/news/device-not-migrated.html) 
  - started by trying mic in a different USB port
  - got as far as deleting the driver and reinstalling via restarting laptop, but got same error. 
  - also tried disabling in device manager and re-enabling
  - Haven't yet tried installing driver via compatibility mode.

Response from them:
- "I would suggest to make sure your USB headphones are set as default playback and communication in your Windows sound settings."
- I went into sound settings and clicked "Manage sound devices" then clicked through to each device. I didn't see a default option, but you can enable or disable each device, so I did that.
