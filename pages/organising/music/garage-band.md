## Where files are stores

- Home/Music/GarageBand

## Getting started

- New empty project - it gives you a bunch of anoying options, none of which look like what you want - select drum track.
- You'll get a "SoCal" track

## Sequencing notes - getting started

- Right-click in the left part of the "track pad" which is the main bit top right where your "SoCal" track is
    - the left part is where it says SoCal and has mute and headphone buttons
- Select "New Software Instrument Track"

## Sequencing notes - adding notes

- Start with [sequencing start](#sequencing-notes---getting-started)
- Right-click in the right hand section, where the wav form for the SoCal track is
- Select "Create MIDI region"
- Drag right hand edge to the right to fill more bars
    - If you drag from the middle of the right hand edge you just make a larger region
    - If you drag from the top, you create a repeat - so the first part will repeat the same
- Double click in your green midi region, or press P on the keyboard
    - this brings up the piano roll section at the bottom of the screen
- Hit the command key and click to add notes
- every time you add a note it will sound out loud, so keep clicking to find the note you want
- drag edges of notes to make them shorter / longer

## Getting an instrument that sounds like a voice

- Start with [getting started](#getting-started)
- Then [sequencing start](#sequencing-notes---getting-started)
- Click the Library icon top left - looks a bit like a drawer in a filing cabinet
- Search for "choir" and select one of the options
- To change the instrument, just select the left hand end of the track, click library again, search for a new instrument and click on it / select it
