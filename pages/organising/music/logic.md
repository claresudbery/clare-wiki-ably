## Simple notes on getting started in Logic 

### Brand new song

- click on Logic Pro X on desktop
- nothing happens but you get new system bar at the top: use File | New

### Adding a new track 

- Main view - plus button top left to add new track 
- Audio is to record new stuff using mic
- Drummer is clever drummer AI
- Software instrument is for sequencing

### Sequencing notes

- New track | Software instrument is what you want
- Click Synthesizer bottom left to get you off sythesizer
- Most reliable instruments are in legacy | Logic
- It's very hit and miss
- good guitar: Legacy | Logic | World | Mexican Guitarron
- Select your track in main view, then click dropdown in top menu bar and select pencil tool instead of pointer tool
- Then click in the main grid to create a new section for that track. You can drag it at the edge to make it bigger.
- To copy/paste to repeat it, use alt click and drag in main grid
- In the piano roll view, you can switch to pointer view and select multiple notes to drag them around in the grid
- If you lose your piano roll, just double-click the section in the main grid to get it back again.
- To repeat a section, in the main view you can drag from the top right corner of the section and it will create repeating blocks
- You can also switch to pointer view in the main grid, select a bunch of stuff across tracks and then use alt drag to copy it elsewhere in the grid
- Tempo is number at top of window in blue. 
- To change instrument: Select a track in left panel, then library can be used to change instrument
- Repeat playback:
    - If you want to listen to one section repeatedly, drag the sections at the top of the main view, they will highlight in orange, then click the recycle button, top left main window.

### Drum tracks without sequencing individual notes:

- Create new track, select Drummer - it's an AI that will automate a drum sequence in the style you want
- You can select a drummer in the library
- Then in the drummer view,
    - change the presets on the left
    - Move the yellow dot around in the left panel
    - Click on drums / percussion to add things
    - Use the sliders on the right
    - Use the Fills knob to add more fills

### Drum tracks where you sequence individual notes:

- new track, software instrument, drum kit sounds like real drums, electronic drum kit doesn't

### Recording a new vocal

- Click + to add new track, select audio, click the R button, wait for it to flash red, then click the big red button at the top of the app.
- Click track:
    - There's a purple metronome icon at the top for a click track, and click the numbers to the left of the icon get a count in.
- Use the main vertical line indicator to show whereabouts in the track it will start recording.
- See [separate page](/pages/organising/music/Recording#recording-vocals-guitar-using-our-pa) on how to record vocals using our PA setup

### Distortion / FX

- You can distort a whole track by clicking in the region view to the left of the main view, then select a plugin in the Audio FX section on the left. 
    - Amps and pedals | pedal board are particularly good. 
        - Click Play before you add the effect, then you'll hear it be applied in real time.
- Fiddle around with the velocity in the piano roll to change how things sound.

### Bass / EQ

- To increase the bass, use the EQ button in the left panel. Felix uses Channel EQ - a plugin.
- Channel EQ:
    - drag regions around in the graph to change bass
    - There is a purple dot, a green dot and a yellow dot (and some other colours too) that you can click and drag around to change things.
    - Or you can click a dot, then it will create a region that you can expand or contract. Then drag the dot around to warp it.
