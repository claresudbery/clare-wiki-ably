## Recording vocals / guitar using our PA

- turn on PA
- use the red gismo (Behringer u-control) with two phono cables (inputs) and one USB (output)
- plug the phono cables into the PA recording output, top right, "l+r rec o/p"
- turn the volume up
- turn up power amp output level (lower right)
- fiddle with the volume on the red gismo
- plug headphones into red gismo - for some reason it won't work without this??
