## Clare singing

- [Here is a rough playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXjhYtWbEdI&list=PLNJwA3LE0_4FFJBRV57c-ECKdnN0Q6-pk). I don't have any decent recordings because I am a rank amateur! So the quality is patchy to say the least.
- The songs on the playlist are: 
  - *Molly the Bandit* - written by me, accompanied on the hoof (they'd never even seen the music before) by a fantastic band called Geriatric Jazz.
  - *Summertime* - @AllyFogg (my husband) on guitar, recorded on a phone in our garden.
  - *That ole Devil Called Love* (Billie Holiday / Alison Moyet) - me on piano, recorded on phone.
  - *Fever* (a la Peggy Lee (ish)) - Ally on guitar + we made our own backing track, using very basic technology. We decided the genre was "techno blues".
  - *Summertime* again - this time not soloing, just singing with a gospel choir. Recorded in a church, on phone, but lovely natural reverb from the building.
  - *How I Got Over* (Mahalia Jackson / Aretha Franklin) - backed by gospel choir. Recorded in church. No mic, so my voice is a bit strained in the second half when the backing singers pick up.
  - *Mamma Mia* (Abba) - Ally on guitar. An experimental slow version. Trying to pull each other back from the beat, which means we struggled to sync up. Recorded on phone.
  - *For You* (Eric Bibb) - Ally on guitar. Recorded at our wedding (so you get to see my amazing wedding dress - this is the only one with actual video footage). I was kind of distracted with, you know, getting married... so I don't think I did a brilliant job, but the context makes it moving.

## Chitty chitty bang bang Doll on a music box duet

### Doll on a music box

What do you see
You people gazing at me
You see a doll on a music box
That's wound by a key
How can you tell
I'm under a spell
I'm waiting for love's first kiss
You cannot see
How much I long to be free
Turning around on this music box
That's wound by a key
Yearning
Yearning
While
I'm turning around and around

### Truly scrumptious 

Truly Scrumptious
You're truly truly scrumptious
Scrumptious as a cherry peach parfait
When your near us
It's so delicious
Honest Truly, you're the answer to my wishes
Truly Scrumptious
Though it may seem presumptuous
Never, never, ever go away
My heart beats so unruly
Because I love you truly
Honest Truly, I do
