## Chrome

### Refresh your cache

- [Refresh your cache - When hitting F5 just isn't enough!](http://refreshyourcache.com/en/cache/)

### Searching Bookmarks and History

- Add Bookmarks and History as separate "search engines"
    - Settings | Manage Search Engines | Add Search Engine
    - Give them a single-letter keyword each
    - Bookmarks: chrome://bookmarks/?#q=%s
    - History: chrome://history/?#q=%s
- Now you can access those from the omnibox
    - The omnibox is the browser search bar
    - On Windows: Ctrl + L
    - On Mac: Cmd(splat) + L
    - Then enter the keyword (configured abnove - I'm using b for bookmarks and h for history) and hit Tab
    - Note that on Mac Catalina I'm finding that any search term you enter directly will get crappy results, so I just enter a random character and then tab inyo the actual search text box

## Gmail / Google Calendar

- Add bullet list: Cmd + Shift + 8
  - Indent a sub item: Ctrl + ] to indent right, Ctrl + [ to indent left
- [Other gmail shortcuts](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/gmail-keyboard-shortcuts)
- [Stop receiving notifications when people respond to invitations, etc](https://xfanatical.com/blog/how-to-turn-off-the-rsvp-responses-from-google-calendar/#:~:text=In%20the%20left%20panel%20%3E%20Settings,select%20None%20for%20this%20entry.) - note that this is set in the settings for each individual calendar, NOT in teh general Google Calendar settings - that's why it's so hard to find!

## Hangouts

- To avoid playing whackamole with the infuriating toolbar at the bottom...
  - To mute/unmute yourself: Cmd + D (Ctrl + D in Windows)
  - To toggle video: Cmd + E (Ctrl + E in Windows)

## Slack

### Useful Slack shortcuts

- [More here](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/201374536-Slack-keyboard-shortcuts#mac-1)
- Cmd k \[channel name or person name\] to open new channel or direct conversation – eg `Cmd + k +
    nagiosdeploy`
  - Ctrl + K on Windows
- Cmd + Shift + \\ - emoji reactions to someone’s post
- :\[emoji name\] – emojis embedded in posts
- \`\[code\]\` (ie text encased by back ticks) - code

  - On Windows: Alt + <- or ->
- Cmd + Shift + T: Open the threads view
- Cmd + Shift + M: Show "activity" / mentions - ie times when you've been @ed (also accessed via @ symbol top right)

### Searching slack

  - If you want to search for a term in a particular channel: in the
    search box (top right):
    
      - Like this: **roadmap in:observability-priv**
    
      - Actually it’s this: **roadmap in:\#observability-priv**
    
      - ...but the hash symbol gets inserted for you if you forget it.

### Scheduling Slack Messages

- I seem to have installed [this](https://slackscheduler.com/blogs/slack-scheduler-blog/how-to-send-a-slack-message-at-a-specific-time), but I think it's a free trial that only lasts 7 days?
- [This](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/slack-tips/schedule-messages-in-the-future) looks worth looking at.

### Other Slack Stuff

- See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ydXrsZX_g9uyvgMoZUovT0G8L5OcrXxRQDSWzw3ULDo/edit) (Clare only) (try searching for **?learn**)

## Emoticons in the browser

- Google docs / Google products only?
- Ctrl + cmd + space to embed emojis
- NB: In google sheets you have to be in the formula input for it to
  work.

## Trello

### Voting functionality

- To add voting functionality to Trello, click the menu top right, then select powerups and search for the Voting powerup to add it.
- Once it's added you can vote on Trello cards by hovering over and pressing on the keyboard, or opening up the card and finding the Vote button on the right.
- You can then order cards in a column by how many votes they have, by clicking the three dots at the top right of the column and selecting "Sort by..." then "votes".

### Other quick shortcuts

- **Copying / pasting cards between boards**: Simply hover over a card and use Ctrl + C / Cmd + C, then go to the destination board and use Ctrl + V / Cmd + V.
- **Adding your name to a card**: Hover over it and press the spacebar (doesn't work if the new card bit at the bottom has focus).

### File Explorer breaks / changes appearance after Windows 10 update.

This fixed my problem:

"I also had a problem with the changed appearance of File explorer.  Turned out the navigation pane had disappeared.   Select View option, select the down arrow at Navigation pane (top left), in the drop down menu tick the box beside Navigation pane.  It's back to the way I like it." From here: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/file-explorer-changed-appearance-after-update/3306555e-05f6-438c-87de-66ed2b0cae2c

### Show desktop on MacBook

- What I've done is go into system preferences and set up a hot key - if you click the right hand alt / option key, that'll do it.

### If your browser suddenly goes hyper-zoomed-in on Chrome on a Macbook

- Cmd + 0 will fix that.
