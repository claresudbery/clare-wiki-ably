## Non-Fungible Token (NFT)

- Great explanation [here](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq)

## Slugs

- mywebsite.co.uk/find-your-collection-day – “find-your-collection-day” is a slug

## Debounce

- Wait some milliseconds before sending (eg) ajax search requests (while typing)

## Declarative vs Imperative

- Declarative: Declare an intent without specifying implementation detail. Eg Linq
- Imperative: Say HOW it will be done. Eg detailed for loops?

## SOAP and REST and SOAP vs REST

- See UsefulNotes.docx (available to Clare only - TW-Stuff/Organising/Notes)

## Saff squeeze

- First taught to me by Mark Kirschstein in a workshop at LateRooms
- A way of debugging
- Gradually narrow down the possible lines of code that might contain the bug
- Kent Beck: 
  - "works by taking a failing test and progressively inlining parts of it until you can't inline further without losing sight of the defect. Here's the cycle:
    - Inline a non-working method in the test.
    - Place a (failing) assertion earlier in the test than the existing assertions.
    - Prune away parts of the test that are no longer relevant.
    - Repeat."
- [More here](https://www.infoq.com/news/2008/11/beck-saff-squeeze/)
- Same concept as binary search algorithm?
- Similar concept to [Diff Debugging](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DiffDebugging.html)?
