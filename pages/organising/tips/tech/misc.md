## Chrome

### Searching Bookmarks and History

- Add Bookmarks and History as separate "search engines"
    - Settings | Manage Search Engines | Add Search Engine
    - Give them a single-letter keyword each
    - Bookmarks: chrome://bookmarks/?#q=%s
    - History: chrome://history/?#q=%s
- Now you can access those from the omnibox
    - The omnibox is the browser search bar
    - On Windows: Ctrl + L
    - On Mac: Cmd(splat) + L
    - Then enter the keyword (configured abnove - I'm using b for bookmarks and h for history) and hit Tab
    - Note that on Mac Catalina I'm finding that any search term you enter directly will get crappy results, so I just enter a random character and then tab inyo the actual search text box
