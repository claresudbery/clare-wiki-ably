## Chrome

### Searching Bookmarks and History

- Add Bookmarks and History as separate "search engines"
    - Settings | Manage Search Engines | Add Search Engine
    - Give them a single-letter keyword each
    - Bookmarks: chrome://bookmarks/?#q=%s
    - History: chrome://history/?#q=%s
- Now you can access those from the omnibox
    - The omnibox is the browser search bar
    - On Windows: Ctrl + L
    - On Mac: Cmd(splat) + L
    - Then enter the keyword (configured abnove - I'm using b for bookmarks and h for history) and hit Tab
    - Note that on Mac Catalina I'm finding that any search term you enter directly will get crappy results, so I just enter a random character and then tab inyo the actual search text box

## Slack

### Misc

  - Cmd k \[channel name\] to open new channel – eg Cmd + k +
    nagiosdeploy

  - Cmd + Shift + \\ - emoji reactions to someone’s post

  - :\[emoji name\] – emojis embedded in posts

  - \`\[code\]\` (ie text encased by back ticks) - code

### Searching slack

  - If you want to search for a term in a particular channel: in the
    search box (top right):
    
      - Like this: **roadmap in:observability-priv**
    
      - Actually it’s this: **roadmap in:\#observability-priv**
    
      - ...but the hash symbol gets inserted for you if you forget it.

## Emoticons in the browser

  - Google docs / Google products only?

  - Ctrl + cmd + space to embed emojis

  - NB: In google sheets you have to be in the formula input for it to
    work.
