## Adding a live music stream to Sonos

(eg [midtempo.net radio station](https://midtempo.net/))

I did it by following the [instructions here](https://support.sonos.com/s/article/260?language=en_US).

The only thing missing from that is that first of all you might have to add TuneIn as a service - you can do that using Settings | Services | Add a service.

And for reference, the streaming url is https://streamingV2.shoutcast.com/midtempo.

## Improving Speaker connectivity

- Sept '25 - there have always been regular dropouts on the speaker in the study, but it seemed to be getting worse
- I always thought it was the WiFi that was dropping, but when I looked in the Sonos app, it said it couldn't connect to the individual Play:1 (Play One) speaker
- Also that speaker kept appearing and disappearing in the Aginet router mesh app, as though that speaker was dropping off the network
- Then I remembered I have a Sonos Boost, which it turned out was not plugged in
- I got the Sonos Boost plugged in and added to the Sonos network, and I haven't had any dropouts since then (3 days later). It's always been intermittent so that doesn't mean it's fixed, but it had been dropping out at least once per day and happened more than once on the day I plugged the Sonos Boost in.
- The Sonos Boost has an ethernet input at the back. I haven't used it, but it's only a couple of metres away from the nearest mesh unit, so that's the next thing I could try if the problem recurs
- I posted [on the Sonos forum about all of this here](https://en.community.sonos.com/speakers-229128/sonos-play-1-keeps-disconnecting-from-wifi-6930937?tid=6930937&postid=16867561&utm_source=community-care&utm_medium=systememail&utm_campaign=en-topic-answered#post16867561)
	- I got a reply:
	- I suggest that you [submit a diagnostic](https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/submit-diagnostics) while the system is functional and again immediately after one of the failures. Follow up with SONOS phone support.
	- Don’t Factory Reset anything before contacting support because this will destroy useful diagnostic data.
	- Is that “thingy (white box)” a “BRIDGE” or “BOOST”. BRIDGE is essentially EOL (End of Life) and can cause intermittent issues. At inception in 2005 SONOS had developed their own private mesh. At that time consumer level mesh products were not available. BRIDGE was developed to provide the wired connection when a player was not needed at the most practical wired network location or BRIDGE/BOOST could be used (wired or wireless) to extend the mesh coverage area. At this point WiFi and consumer level mesh networking is very capable and in most cases BRIDGE/BOOST can simply be powered down. SONOS support will probably suggest this to you. In fact, newly developed SONOS products do not support SonosNet (the SONOS mesh). I suggest that you wait for support to recommend removing BRIDGE/BOOST because you might suddenly be confronted with some tech.
