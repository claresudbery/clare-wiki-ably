## Adding a live music stream to Sonos

(eg [midtempo.net radio station](https://midtempo.net/))

I did it by following the [instructions here](https://support.sonos.com/s/article/260?language=en_US).

The only thing missing from that is that first of all you might have to add TuneIn as a service - you can do that using Settings | Services | Add a service.

And for reference, the streaming url is https://streamingV2.shoutcast.com/midtempo.
