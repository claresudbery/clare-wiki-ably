## Listen in bandcamp ios app

- If you've bought an album, click the little heart at the bottom to get to favourites
	- Select collection => albums and tracks

## Listen on speakers from ios app

- Use another app to set up airplay
	- eg Youtube - play a video and then click the airplay icon top right - select bluetooth - select speaker
	- Use sonos app to "group" newer bluetooth Sonos speakers with older non-bluetooth speakers
- Then switch back to bandcamp and the music should play on the selected speaker
	- But note that you can also use this method to get Spotify to play on speakers, if the normal route won't work (eg if you're playing a local file in Spotify)
