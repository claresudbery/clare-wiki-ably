### low-res Macbook screenshots - Details

- tl;dr - On Macbook, to turn the most recent screenshot into a small low-res file and paste it into the Career-analysis Obsidian, 3 steps are needed: ^how
	- 1. Take the screenshot (Cmd + Shift + 4)
	- 2. In Obsidian, use the key combination Cmd + Shift + J
		- (you don't actually have to be in Obsidian, but Cmd + Shift + J will do other things in some contexts, eg Chrome)
		- ! Note that you have to wait a few seconds for the screenshot to find its way into the Screenshots folder, otherwise you'll end up with whatever the *previous* shortcut was
	- 3. In Obsidian, use Cmd + V to paste the image into your note
- If you want it to work in other Obsidian vaults, you'll need to edit [this `lowres-screenshot` script](https://github.com/claresudbery/Root-Scripts/blob/master/lowres-screenshot) in my default `scripts` folder ^vault
	- Simplest thing would be to edit the path 
		- I currently have a [[#^vault-details|hack that does this effectively ]]
			- [[#^vault-instr|How to use it]]
	- Second simplest thing would be to edit the script to take a path as input = you could get Claude or ChatGPT to help with this
		- You'd also have to edit the Shortcut in the Shortcuts app, to take inputs
- How / why it was created ^why
	- I created this because I often paste screenshots into Obsidian, and the default Macbook screenshot is an unnecessarily-huge file.
	- I used Claude, and documented the process [here](https://github.com/claresudbery/career-analysis-obsidian/blob/main/Current%20Project%20Notes/0%20-%20Missions/09-AI-Mission/AI%20coding%20projects/_Misc%20small%20AI%20projects.md#get-low-res-macbook-screenshots).
- How it works: ^mechanics
	- The result of my Claude session was a script called `lowres-screenshot` in my `scripts` folder/repo, which means you can now type `lowres-screenshot` on the command line and it will take the most recent screenshot, convert it to jpeg (readable rather than absolute lowest quality), copy to my Career-Analysis Obsidian Attachments folder, then auto-delete the original after copying.
	- I put this into a Cmd + Shift + J keyboard shortcut on my Macbook (using the Shortcuts app - see [Claude session where I first set this up](https://claude.ai/chat/376ea8c6-bf93-41ef-9557-3e6acb69bbf8), or there is a [[#^new-laptop|better summary below]]), or you can just run it from the command line. 
	- Then all you have to do it paste into Obsidian (Career-Analysis)!
- Changing the vault ^vault-details
	- (ie the vault that screenshots go to when you use the Cmd + Shift + J keyboard shortcut)
	- The four vaults currently catered for are:
		- CareerAnalysis Obsidian vault - sometimes referred to below as "career"
		- clare-tech Obsidian vault - sometimes referred to below as "tech"
		- clare-wiki-ably Obsidian vault - sometimes referred to below as "wiki"
		- ClaresAutotraderNotes Obsidian vault - sometimes referred to below as "auto"
	- What to do: ^vault-instr
		- Run one of the following commands on the command line:
			- Change to CareerAnalysis: `cscreen`
			- Change to clare-tech: `tscreen`
			- Change to clare-wiki-ably: `wscreen`
			- Change to ClaresAutotraderNotes: `ascreen`
	- How it works: ^vault-how
		- It's a bit unwieldy on the surface, but it works and it was the quickest easiest thing without getting sucked down a rabbit hole...
		- !This does mean that if you edit the base scripts, you might have to run `wscreen` or whatever to get the correct base script overwritten back onto `lowres-screenshot`
		- There are four copies of `lowres-screenshot` that are identical apart from the path that screenshots are copied to:
			- `lowres-screenshot-script-career`
			- `lowres-screenshot-script-tech`
			- `lowres-screenshot-script-wiki`
			- `lowres-screenshot-script-auto`
		- There are four very simple scripts that just overwrite the default `lowres-screenshot` file with one of the above specialised scripts:
			- `lowres-screenshot-make-career`
			- `lowres-screenshot-make-tech`
			- `lowres-screenshot-make-wiki`
			- `lowres-screenshot-make-auto`
		- There are four aliases that are in `~/scripts/useful-aliases.txt` and `~/.bashrc` - calling each of these aliases causes one of the `lowres-screenshot-make-` scripts above to be called: 
			- Change to CareerAnalysis: `cscreen`
			- Change to clare-tech: `tscreen`
			- Change to clare-wiki-ably: `wscreen`
			- Change to ClaresAutotraderNotes: `ascreen`
- Getting it working on a new laptop / with a new vault: ^new-setup
	- New vault: ^new-vault
		- Make sure your vault has an Attachments folder or equivalent, and configure it in Settings (see [[obsidian#Attachments and images]] for details)
		- Add your vault to the lists above ([[#^vault-instr|here]] and [[#^vault-how|here]])
		- Create a copy of `lowres-screenshot-script-auto` with an appropriate name for your vault and the details changed for your vault (just change the path at the top)
		- Create a copy of `lowres-screenshot-make-auto` with an appropriate name for your vault and the details changed for your vault
		- Add an appropriately named alias to `~/scripts/useful-aliases.txt` and `~/.bashrc` (in same place as `wscreen` etc)
	- New laptop: ^new-laptop
		- Make sure you have the scripts folder with the above scripts (see [[installing-a-new-mac]]), and you're sourcing ~/.bashrc for aliases
		- Go into the Shortcuts app 
		- Click the **+** to create a new shortcut
		- Search in the search box top right for a **"Run Shell Script"** action and double-click it
			- If scripting actions are disabled, click Preferences to sort that ("Allow running scripts")
		- Find out where on your laptop the script lives
			- Run `which lowres-screenshot` on command line
			- Use the resulting full path in the next bit
		- Enter: `/Users/clare.sudbery/scripts/lowres-screenshot` (or whatever your path is)
		- Save with a name like "Process Low Res Screenshot" (enter it at the very top screen where the title is - doesn't look like it's editable but it is)
		- Click the `i` info icon in the top right
		- Choose **"Add Keyboard Shortcut"**
		- In the "Run with" input, press your preferred key combination (Cmd + Shift + J)
		- **In your shortcut editor**, look at the very top where it says "receive images and 18 more"
			- **Click on that text**
			- Unselect all 18 things
			- It will now say "Receive Apps input from quick actions" - this is fine - just ignore it
			- In the "Run Shell Script" action, set the Input dropdown to **"Shortcut Input"**
			- Make sure "Pass Input" is set to **"as arguments"** or **"to stdin"** (either works since our script ignores input anyway)
		- No need to save, it gets saved automatically
		- If you get stuck, [here is the original conversation with Claude](https://claude.ai/chat/376ea8c6-bf93-41ef-9557-3e6acb69bbf8) where I first set this up (log in with SSE Google)
