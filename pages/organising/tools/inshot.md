## To add your own sound

- Create video
- Select the part you care about by tapping on it at thew bottom of the screen.
- Scroll along the toolbar just above, until you reach volume. Turn the volume all the way down. This will mute the original sound.
- Add your music to your phone (instructions [here](/pages/organising/tools/iPhone#add-your-own-music-files-to-your-iphone-using-itunes)) (Select Kinemaster in the list of apps)
- On the left of the toolbar select Music
- this only seems to work with itunes
