## To turn an audio file into a video file for youtube

- (Alternatively, use [Descript](pages/organising/podcasts/descript.md) and just drag and drop the audio into a new video project)
- Create new project
- Add an image using the media section
- Import the audio as per [instructions below](<#to add your own sound>)
- Lengthen the image to last as long as the audio
- Use the export button (top right) to save as video

## To extract sound from video

- Just import video into Audacity then export as audio file!

## To add your own sound

- Create video
- Select the actual video track itself (it will highlight in yellow)
- Click the volume icon (labelled "mixer") 
- Move the volume slider all the way to the bottom
- Add your music to your phone (instructions [here](/pages/organising/tools/iPhone#add-your-own-music-files-to-your-iphone-using-itunes)) (Select Kinemaster in the list of apps)
- Now click Audio on the right hand side
- Go to "internal" to find the music you added
- select it and hit the + button and then the tick
    - !! Don't forget to hit the + button!
- you can drag the resulting audio track to left or right
- you can also use the Trim/split option to do limited cutting, but it seems like after you've done this once, you can't do it again?
- To delete an audio track, select it under the video and then click the bin icon on the left.

## To remove a section from the start of the main media

... when you want all the layers to shift left, which is not the default behaviour.

- Or if you want to make any change that keeps layers in place.
- The answer is to "pin" the layers you want to stay still.
- Explained to me by Kinemaster support staff thus: 
    - Layers adjust their positions relative to videos and images in the Primary Timeline. Adjusting the length of any media clip in the Primary Timeline will push or pull all the layers. Layers remain in the same places relative to the videos and images in the Primary Timeline.
    - There may be times when you would prefer to keep your layers in place. This is what the Pin tool does. To use the Pin tool, tap a layer to select it. Then tap the Pin tool. You can change the length of pinned media in the Primary Timeline without changing its location.

## To add a cover image

- Place the cursor at the start of the video
- Click Media (top right)
- Click Photo (left)
    - select an image (I took a screenshot while playing the finished video, and used this)
- Add a label for the title:
    - Select the new clip
    - Click Layer (top right)
    - Click text
    - Click tick
    - Resize it / position it where you want it
    - Select the label
    - Scroll down a bit (top right) and select Background
    - Turn on "enable"
    - Click the shaded square on the left and choose a colour
    - Use the slider at the bottom to set opacity
- Change the new clip's length in the video
    - By default it's pretty long (4.5 seconds)
    - I changed it to a length of 00:00.177
        - Note that the first time I did this (on my Delta Dawn video), the length I used was 00:00.143, and this worked fine. 
        - But the next time, I used the same length (for Big Dipper) and it didn't get used as the thumbnail. In iPhone photos app it used another clip from the beginning of the main vid. And when I clicked play it seemed to show that for a second at start of playing. 
        - So I changed it to 00:00.177
    - Move the cursor to just left of the start of the original video (I had it at 00:04.323)
    - Select the new clip
    - Click Trim/Split (top right)
    - Click Trim to left of playhead
- Change the length of the new label
    - Use same technique you used to change length of image
