## To add your own sound

- Create video
- Select the actual video track itself (it will highlight in yellow)
- Click the volume icon (labelled "mixer") 
- Move the volume slider all the way to the bottom
- Add your music to your phone (instructions [here](/pages/organising/tools/iPhone#add-your-own-music-files-to-your-iphone-using-itunes)) (Select Kinemaster in the list of apps)
- Now click Audio on the right hand side
- Go to "internal" to find the music you added
- select it and hit the + button and then the tick
    - !! Don't forget to hit the + button!
- you can drag the resulting audio track to left or right
- you can also use the Trim/split option to do limited cutting, but it seems like after you've done this once, you can't do it again?
- To delete an audio track, select it under the video and then click the bin icon on the left.

## To remove a section from the start of the main media

... when you want all the layers to shift left, which is not the default behaviour.

- Or if you want to make any change that keeps layers in place.
- The answer is to "pin" the layers you want to stay still.
- Explained to me by Kinemaster support staff thus: 
    - Layers adjust their positions relative to videos and images in the Primary Timeline. Adjusting the length of any media clip in the Primary Timeline will push or pull all the layers. Layers remain in the same places relative to the videos and images in the Primary Timeline.
    - There may be times when you would prefer to keep your layers in place. This is what the Pin tool does. To use the Pin tool, tap a layer to select it. Then tap the Pin tool. You can change the length of pinned media in the Primary Timeline without changing its location.
