## To add your own sound

- Create video
- Select the actual video track itself (it will highlight in yellow)
- Click the volume icon (labelled "mixer") 
- Move the volume slider all the way to the bottom
- Add your music to your phone (instructions [here](/pages/organising/tools/iPhone#add-your-own-music-files-to-your-iphone-using-itunes)) (Select Kinemaster in the list of apps)
- Now click Audio on the right hand side
- Go to "internal" to find the music you added
- select it and hit the + button and then the tick
- you can drag the resulting audio track to left or right
- you can also use the Trim/split option to do limited cutting, but it seems like after you've done this once, you can't do it again?
- To delete an audio track, select it under the video and then click the bin icon on the left.
