## Overview

- Graphic design tool used to create things like avatars, icons, banners, logos
  - I used it to make the cover images for The Street Pianist podcast episodes - for Buzzsprout and for YoouTube

## How to open up a different design / project

- This is not obvious!
  - If you already have a project open and try to switch to a different one, it keeps doing things like ask you whether to embed the second project into the first one
- How to do it:
  - Click Projects on the left
  - Find the one you're interested in
  - Hover over it til you get three dots, top right
  - Click those dots and select "Open in new tab"
