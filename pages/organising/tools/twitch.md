## Starting a live stream

- I don't _think_ you can do this in the browser
- I think you need to use the Twitch Studio app
    - It's pretty simple to download / install / set up
- ! If you want to share your whole screen it's a good idea to have a second monitor
    - this means you can put any sensitive apps on the second monitor
    - it also means you can place Twitch Studio on the second monitor, and then you'll avoid an infinity mirror
