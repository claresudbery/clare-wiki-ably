## Editing YouTube Videos

### Add an end screen

- ! It might not be what you think it is! 
- I wanted to add a full screen image to the start and end of my video, and that's not what this is
    - I did it using Descript - just drag / drop an image onto the start / end of the transcript, and it will add a silent bit in - which by default is 4 seconds - and will insert dots in the transcript. Delete dots to shorten the elgnth of time it appears for. 
- An "end screen" on youtube is a little mini screen that pops up towards the end of your video, and links to other content - typically another video.
- To add an end screen:
    - Open [youtube studio](https://studio.youtube.com/)
    - Click Content on the left
    - Click Get started
    - Click Editor on the left
    - Select end screen on the left
    - Add an element - select "template" 
    - Click to add an element
    - Select "video"
    - Scroll down to the last option ("choose specific video") if you want to link to an external video - it then lets you search for it
    - You can change the placement of the end screen on the screen, and change other biuts and bobs
    - Click Save
