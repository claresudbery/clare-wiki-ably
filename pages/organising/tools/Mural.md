## Convert text into stickies / postits

1. Copy the multiple lines of text you want to paste to your mural.
2. Right-click the canvas (just canvas, not area) and select Paste.
3. Click the dropdown arrow next to the Paste as icon.
	1. Note: I don't see a dropdown arrow - I just Paste and they automatically get turned into stickies - BUT then a floating paste icon appears (like in Google Sheets), and if I click on it, I get the next bit...
4. Select how you want your text to display: Single paragraph. Multiple sticky notes. Multiple paragraphs.
## Convert stickies into text

- Select Sticky Notes:
	- Use the Shift key to click and drag to select multiple sticky notes or hold Ctrl/Cmd and click each sticky note individually.         
- Copy the text from the sticky notes: 
	- While they're all selected, right-click and select Copy => Copy text
- You can now paste the text elsewhere and it will come out as multiple lines of text - one line per sticky
## Convert stickies into Trello cards

- Start by [[#Convert stickies into text]]
- **Create a new card:** In Trello, go to the list where you want to add the cards and click the "Add a card" button. 
- **Paste your list:** Paste the copied list of lines of text into the card title field. 
- **Trello's detection:** Trello will typically recognize the pasted text as a list and ask if you want to create individual cards from it. 
	- At first it seems like it's just created one Trello card with a multiline title, but as soon as you hit Enter, it'll offer the toption to create multiple cards
- **Confirm card creation:** Select "Create multiple cards" or a similar option (the exact wording may vary depending on the Trello version).
## Troubleshooting

- This was advised to me by an agent when I was having trouble because my text on my stickies was fuzzy and out of focus, even when I zoomed in
	- ...although actually in the end I didn't do any of the below. I had more than one browser window open, so I could compare two Murals on two different screens. I closed Mural down in one browser window and then refreshed it in the other, and that fixed it. Then opened it up again in the other browser and it started working again.
- (You might need to close the chat/browser in order to do this, so you can write to us again or send us an email at [support@mural.co](mailto:support@mural.co))
- To begin with, if you're not already doing so, please use the Google Chrome browser to access Mural. 
	- Mural works best in Google Chrome (v51 and above), Firefox (v46 and above), and the most recent version of Microsoft Edge.﻿﻿ 
- Once you're in Chrome, please follow these steps: 
1. Sign out of Mural by entering this command in the URL: [https://app.mural.co/bye](https://app.mural.co/bye) 
2. Clear all cached data and cookies from the browser history. 
3. Sign in to Mural from this web address: [https://app.mural.co](https://app.mural.co/) 
4. If you're still having difficulties, try opening an Incognito/private browsing window in Chrome and repeat step 3 above. 
5. In many situations these steps will resolve the issue, so please give them a try and let me know how you get on.
