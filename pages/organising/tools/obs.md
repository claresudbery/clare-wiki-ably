# Getting started

- Downloade and install from obsproject.com
- First time in:
    - Click through the differrent settings
    - Don't need to do "quit & reopen" can just hit later
    - Set up all the system permissions it prompts you for
    - Optimise just for recording
    - Base canvas resolution = 1920 x 1080 for O'Reilly
        - standard 16:9 1080p blah
    - FPS = Frames per second, smaller means smlaler file sizes, O'Reilly want 30
- Go to Setitngs, lower right
    - Select output on left
        - output mode: advanced
            - select recording tab
                - recording format: MP4
                - video encoder: apple vt H264 hardware encoder
                - encoder settings 
                    - bitrate: 5000
                    - keyframe interval: 0s
                        - it either records a full frame or a differential from the last keyframe
                        - the interval makes the difference to how often it stores keyframes
                        - how many keyframes there are also affects editing - are you editing a keyframe? Better if you are.
        - Video bit rate = 5000
        - Audio bit rate = 320
            - O'Reilly spec says 32kbps for audio qualoity but shgould prob be 320!
        - Recording - recoridngp tha - this is where recordings will go
            - this hsould be local not in cloud!
        - Recording quality: high quality, medium file size
        - Audio encoder: AAC
    - Select Audio on left
        - Enable push-to-mute if youu want
            - can set up hot keys so you can mute quickly if you're coughing or whatever
    - Select hotkeys on left
        - Most useful is probably pause / unpause
        - Split recording file
            - Allows you to stop recording in current file and start a new file, eg if you istake and want to do over
    - Select advanced on left
        - recording filename formatting is here
- Top tips
    - Clap hands or use dog clicker to make large noise that will be easy to find in the audio to go back and find a particular spot
- Recording
    - Scene
        - a screen is basically a screen layout
        - you get one by default - can rename to Desktop
        - hit plus button at bottom of Scenes pane - can call ClareCam to represent face on screen
        - Select a scene
            - Go to sources section, hit plus to add a source
            - Then select the source to change settings (might have to restart OBS if you changed other stuff previously)
            - Select the right display
            - Check "Hide OBS from capture"
            - while the source si selected, hit Cmd + F to fit the capture to your screen
            - If you get black bars on left and right that's because the aspect ratio of your screen resolution does not match your target (eg 16:9)
            - you can drag things around to get rid of black bars - tradeoff is that you might lose the top or bottom of your screen to get rid of black bars on left or right
                - the red box is not the thing that will show up on the video
                - the green box is the same, just indicates you're not editing it any more
                - the area you can see if the area that will show up on video
            - Set up second scene
                - Source = Vdieo capture device
                - Cmd + F to fill screen
                - Hit lock icon on source to lock it
                - Drag things around as before
- Performance
    - Bottom right you can see CPU and FPS
    - you don't want FPS to go down 
    - Docks => Stats - select to toggle on 
    - Frames missed due to redenring lag will show in red
        - ideally you want that as close to 0 as poss
        - more of a concern for face than for code
        - To fix, change stuff 
            - settings (bottom right)
                - output on left - recording tab 
                    - change video encoder to x264
                        - ! This might reset your encoder settings at the bottom!
                    - change bitrate to 4000
                    - change profile to main
            - then hit OK then hit Reset button mid right
            - laptop system settings
                - display resolution - make smaller
- double-click title bar at top of window to get it to fit Mac screen
