- I've used Kit (formerly ConvertKit) to create a newsletter
- It was recommended to me by the Stacking the Bricks / 30x500 product development course
- You can subscribe to my newsletter [here](https://queen-of-questions.kit.com/)
- You can create your own account [here](https://kit.com/)
  - Watch out!
  - By default you'll be put on a paid plan, which will take you through creating some fancy home pages and stuff
  - But if you then downgrade to the free plan, all that stuff will disappear!
- Kit gives both a barrier-free way of publishing blog posts and subscribing customers to your newsletter.
- To have blog posts show on the subscription page:
  - Grow => Creator profile => Newsletter posts => Show newsletter posts (toggle this to on)
- To send a new broadcast out:
  - You need at least one subscriber
  - You won't get subscribers unless people both click to Subscribe AND click the Confirm button in the subsequent confirmationm email
    - !! This confirmation email may well end up in spam folders!
  - Click Send => Broadcasts => New broadcast
  - Click on a template
    - This isn't obvious - you have to click on the image
    - Give it a subject line
    - Add some content
    - Might have to wait a few seconds, then the Continue button bottom right will be highlighted
    - Click Continue
      - Select the options you want
    - Click Continue again
    - It may take quite a long time before it lands in inboxes
      - But check spam folders!
