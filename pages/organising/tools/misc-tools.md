## YouTube timestamp

To add a time stamp to a YouTube video, add `?t=43` tp the end of the url.

The time is in seconds, so if you want to go more than 60 seconds in, just calculate the total num of seconds. For instance 1:30 would be `?t=90`

Like this: https://youtu.be/imNlIoeCjao?t=43

## Due app

### Accessing deleted items

- To access deleted items in Due, go to settings => backup and email a backup to yourself. But do it quickly! Depending how often you use the app you might have less than 24 hours of backups.
- Top tips:
  - If you want to access something deleted, do it asap
  - Don't delete things! Use the tick button instead, to log things done.

## Drawing tools

- Free tools:
  - [Google drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings)
  - [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) (not the same as Google drawings but integrates with Google drive)
- Paid:

## Snapdrop: "Like airdrop, but for everything"

Share files between any two devices: https://snapdrop.net/

## Phantom Buster

[Phantom Buster](https://phantombuster.com/automations/linkedin/9227/linkedin-message-sender) is another tool you can also to send linkedin messages - similar to [Dux Soup](#dux-soup).

## Dux Soup 

Dux soup is a LinkedIn marketing tool

Some simple info that might help if you're finding Dux Soup confusing:

- It's a browser extension - nothing to do with LinkedIn itself
  - It automates LikedIn interactions by clicking through LinkedIn links on your behalf
- Whenever Dux soup visits a profile on your behalf, it stores data from that profile and can tag that stored data with a configured tag which you can later use to search with (see Dux Soup Options => Actions)
- Use Dux Soup Options => Actions to define what will happen whenever a profile is visited - including sending personal messages
- Use the "scan profile" functionality to scan headline info (basically just name and profile id) from LinkedIn search results
- Use the "download data" functionality to download scanned data - or more detailed data from visited profiles - in csv form
- Use the "revisit data" functionality to upload your own edited csvs and visit all the profiles in the csv (potentially also messaging each person)
- Visit the "skipping" and "throttling" sections in Dux soup options to define whether profiles are revisited and also how many profiles you visit per day. Thie is important - if you get it wrong you might get banned from LinkedIn!!

See marketing.md in clare-tech for more detailed notes (Accessible to Clare only).

## How to make Zoom record individual voices locally

## Redis 

- In memory key value store, at Samba was not in application 

## Finding birth + death certificates

- [Free public service to find death certificates](https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/search.pl)
  - Or you can [search the GRO index](https://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/indexes_search.asp) - which actually seems to be more accurate (my great-grandmother's age at death was listed inaccurately on the other site) - and then order copies directly from GRO.

## Letterboxd - adding notes to films

- I've already created a custom list "want to watch" under my profile
- To see existing notes:
  - Claresudbery | Lists
  - Select the list
  - click "List view" (icon wi horizontal lines, top right) to see notes
- To add a new film with note / add a note:
  - It varies per platform
  - The important thing is to look for the edit icon
  - On desktop you only see the edit icon (little pencil) BEFORE you click through to the list itself
  - On mobile you see it by clicking through to the list and THEN clicking the three dots top right and selecting edit - but you have to do this while looking at the whole list, not when looking at an individual film (then click Edit entries, then select the film you want to edit from the list that comes up)
  - I suspect maybe you can't add a note while adding a film - you have to go back and add the note afterwards?

## Creating nicely formatted snippets of code for slides etc

- One good tool for snippets of code is [carbon.now](https://carbon.now.sh/)
  - It can be fiddly if you want to correct mistakes (because you can’t necessarily reverse engineer back to code from rendered image)
  - But it turns out you can give it a gist url](https://github.com/carbon-app/carbon#usage), which is a much better way of keeping track
