## YouTube timestamp

To add a time stamp to a YouTube video, add `?t=43` tp the end of the url.

The time is in seconds, so if you want to go more than 60 seconds in, just calculate the total num of seconds. For instance 1:30 would be `?t=90`

Like this: https://youtu.be/imNlIoeCjao?t=43

## Due app

### Accessing deleted items
