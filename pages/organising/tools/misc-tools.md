## YouTube timestamp

To add a time stamp to a YouTube video, add `?t=43` tp the end of the url.

The time is in seconds, so if you want to go more than 60 seconds in, just calculate the total num of seconds. For instance 1:30 would be `?t=90`

Like this: https://youtu.be/imNlIoeCjao?t=43

## Due app

### Accessing deleted items

- To access deleted items in Due, go to settings | backup and email a backup to yourself. But do it quickly! Depending how often you use the app you might have less than 24 hours of backups.
- Top tips:
  - If you want to access something deleted, do it asap
  - Don't delete things! Use the tick button instead, to log things done.

  - [Google drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings)

## Snapdrop: "Like airdrop, but for everything"

Share files between any two devices: https://snapdrop.net/

## Phantom Buster

[Phantom Buster](https://phantombuster.com/automations/linkedin/9227/linkedin-message-sender) is another tool you can also to send linkedin messages - similar to [Dux Soup](#dux-soup).

## Dux Soup 

Dux soup is a LinkedIn marketing tool

Some simple info that might help if you're finding Dux Soup confusing:

- It's a browser extension - nothing to do with LinkedIn itself
  - It automates LikedIn interactions by clicking through LinkedIn links on your behalf
- Whenever Dux soup visits a profile on your behalf, it stores data from that profile and can tag that stored data with a configured tag which you can later use to search with (see Dux Soup Options | Actions)
- Use Dux Soup Options | Actions to define what will happen whenever a profile is visited - including sending personal messages
- Use the "scan profile" functionality to scan headline info (basically just name and profile id) from LinkedIn search results
- Use the "download data" functionality to download scanned data - or more detailed data from visited profiles - in csv form
- Use the "revisit data" functionality to upload your own edited csvs and visit all the profiles in the csv (potentially also messaging each person)
- Visit the "skipping" and "throttling" sections in Dux soup options to define whether profiles are revisited and also how many profiles you visit per day. Thie is important - if you get it wrong you might get banned from LinkedIn!!
