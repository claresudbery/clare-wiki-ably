## Headlines

- Xero accounting software
- Used as a replacement for QuickBooks cos easier to work with
- Mostly managed by Emma

## Mtg with Emma 4/6/25 to learn the nuts and bolts

## Overview

- Dashboard = front page
- Monzo - reconcile items - Emma does this once a month
- Emma has set up rules to match
	- The more times Emma does the same hting, it just recognises it
	- There isn't a place you can go to see rules
- Already reconciled - look at "Bank statements" and they are marked on the right either reconciled or unreconciled
	- Looks like "account transactipns is everything that's been reconciled"
	- on the "Reconcile" tab you can see "balance in Xero" £2014.41 which means there are £2014.41 worth of unreconciled transactions

## Accessing Settings

- Click business name, top left
## Invoices & clients

## Creating invoices

- Go Business => Invoices
- It will make you add an "item" with a "code"
- To see all items created so far, go to Business => Products and Services (all the way down at the bottom of the menu)
- To edit payment details or contact details: [[#Adding payment and contact details to invoices]]
	- This won't all be visible on the main page, but you'll see it when you click Oreview (top of page)
- To add a new client, 
	- start typing in the Contact field to create a new one...
		- ...!!! but this won't add any useful details like email address etc, so better to...
	- ...select Contacts at top of main page to manage all clients / contacts
- You can preview (top of page) to check everything looks OK
	- Contact email won't appear in preview but will be used when you send
- Finally click Approve & email (top right)
### Adding payment and contact details to invoices

- To edit payment or contact details:
- Settings (Click business name, top left) => Invoice settings
- Select the invoice template
- Click Options (top right) => Edit
### <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Reconciling invoices</span>

- £450 from Software Cornwall arrived in Monzo 3/6/25
- Will happen during normal reconciliation
	- There's normally a 24-hr lag from Monzo
	- Transactions that match invoices will be automatically set as available for matching cos they'll spot the amount matching

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Checking which invoices are still due</span>

- What is the invoice ID of Tobey's latest invoice (for May)? Add to spreadsheet
- Click "Invoices still due" from the dashboard
	- or click Business at the top then select Invoices

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Adding new clients</span>

- Contacts up at the top
- Or start a new invoice and do it as part of that
- You can change the currency at any point

## <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Foreign currencies</span>

- Wise bank account<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"></span>
- Currency conversion
	- There's a separate line in accounts for banking fee, exchange rate fluctuations are calculated by Xero independently
	- You can add it manually but it won't know about it otherwise
	- The amounts are so small you can probably ignore it

## Current assets and liabilities

- Accounting => Reports => Balance Sheet

## Moving accounts between business and personal

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">If I paid for money from business that should have been from personal</span>

- eg Spotify £19.99 18/2/25
	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">This was last year! Ignore anything that's already been included by Louis in the accounts!</span>
	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Disabled person, used music as part of work to quiet my brain! Move payment permanently to Monzo!</span>
- and CraftPickle £27.98 20/5/25
	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Emma isn't too bothered - but if I want to, I can just pay the money into the account and let Emma know for reconciliation purposes</span>

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">If I paid for money from personal that should have been from business</span>

- eg £7.99 21/5/25, Google payments are coming out of AmEx instead of Monzo!
