#### APPLE technique to deal with anxiety

AnxietyUK suggests practising the "Apple" technique to deal with anxiety and worries.

- **Acknowledge**: Notice and acknowledge the anxiety as it comes to mind.
- **Pause**: Don't react as you normally do. Don't react at all. Pause and breathe.
- **Pull back**: Tell yourself this is just the worry talking, and any apparent need to know exactly what will happen next is not helpful and not necessary. It is only a thought or feeling. Don't believe everything you think. Thoughts are not statements or facts.
- **Let go**: Let go of the thought or feeling. It will pass. You don't have to respond to them. You might imagine them floating away in a bubble or cloud.
- **Explore**: Explore the present moment, because right now, in this moment, all is well. Notice your breathing and the sensations of your breathing. Notice the ground beneath you. Look around and notice what you see, what you hear, what you can touch, what you can smell. Right now. Then shift your focus of attention to something else - on what you need to do, on what you were doing before you noticed the worry, or do something else - mindfully with your full attention.
  
#### ODAAT - One Day at a Time

This is an edited version of a description of this technique from my friend Lou:

"In order to stay calm, you have to be calm one day at a time. I find it a great way to ground myself if I'm starting to live in the future (futile, not happened yet) or past (not helpful as can't change etc) That's not to say that you shouldn't plan for the future or neglect the lessons of the past but by staying in our head there, we're not present in the place where we actually have some control.

Here's an example. Say you plan to have a re-decorated sitting room by the end of this period of social distancing / wfh / isolating.

Your locus of control is now - that's where you order the paint / brushes and other things you need. It's also where you do the painting. Reminiscing about how you didn't order enough paint last time, or daydreaming about how it will look when finished are exercises of the mind - they don't help you achieve the actual task. Likewise beating yourself up about how you fuck ed it up last time or telling yourself that you are shit at DIY and therefore being scared to start is another future dwelling pointless exercise. Things that would be of use like " I did Y last time and it resulted in unwelcome X - perhaps if I try A it will be better" is a more helpful way of framing / planning, and is useful." 

Try to pay attention to the positive things you have achieved each day, and give yourself some acknowledgement for those things. And be kind to yourself when circumstances make it hard to follow any kind of plan.
