## Daft Games

- Everything from Taskmaster (see book). For instance...
    - Standing on a bridge and popping up every 30 seconds for 30 seconds. When you're ducked down, somebody down below the bridge has to try and approach the bridge. Bit like What time is it Mr Wolf. Every time you pop up and bob down, blow a horn or make some kind of loud noise.

## Remote Games

### Really Boring Website

[Really Boring Website](https://really.boring.website/) - you have to think of things beginning with a particular letter, then you vote for each other's answers.

### QuizBreaker

### The Wikipedia game

- One person chooses a wikipedia page, eg "Harry Potter". Somebody else then chooses an entirely unrelated wikipedia page - eg "Scissors". 
- It is then the job of the entire group to try and get from the first page to the second one ONLY by clicking links in the page content. 
- You can't click on links anywhere else on the page, you can't use the search function, you can't use the back button, you can't even use Ctrl+F to search the words on the page itself (you have to scan with your eyes). 
- First person to land on the second page wins, and has to choose the next page that everyone must try and reach (from the page reached in the previous round).

### The lip-reading game

- Take it in turn for one person to mute themselves and say something towards the camera.
- Other players have to lip-read and guess what the person is saying.
- First person to guess correctly is the next person to mute and speak.
- As for what to say, phrases wre harder (and funnier) than single words.
- Give all players a chance to maximise the person talking before they start.
- You can choose a category - eg film titles - although film titles are surprisingly easy to guess (it's funnier if it's harder, because then you get more hilarious bad guesses - for instance when my son guessed "military bag of raw meat" instead of "middle-aged man on roller skates").
    - My favourite thing to use is the cards from a Cards Against Humanity set (use the white cards - the phrases that are used to fill in the blanks).
    - You can download a [free version as a pdf here](cards-against-humanity.en.softonic.com/#), under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license (CC BY-NC-SA).
    - It is acceptable for the current player (the mimer) to "pass" on any phrase and move onto the next.
