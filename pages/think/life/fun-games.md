## Daft Games

- Everything from Taskmaster (see book). For instance...
    - Standing on a bridge and popping up every 30 seconds for 30 seconds. When you're ducked down, somebody down below the bridge has to try and approach the bridge. Bit like What time is it Mr Wolf. Every time you pop up and bob down, blow a horn or make some kind of loud noise.

## Remote Games

- [Really Boring Website](https://really.boring.website/) - you have to think of things beginning with a particular letter, then you vote for each other's answers.
- [QuizBreaker - Virtual Team Building Game for Remote Teams](https://www.quizbreaker.com/)
- **The Wikipedia game**: One person chooses a wikipedia page, eg "Harry Potter". Somebody else then chooses an entirely unrelated wikipedia page - eg "Scissors". It is then the job of the entire group to try and get from the first page to the second one ONLY by clicking links in the page content. Yu can't click on links anywhere else on the page, you can't use the search function, you can't use the back button, you can't even search the words on the page itself (you have to scan with your eyes). First person to land on the second page wins, and has to choose the next page that everyone must try and reach.
