## What is this page all about?

There are certain questions that I often find myself asking, but someow never remember the answers. The problem I've always had whenever I rediscover those answers is... where can I make a note of this so that I'll know where to come the next time I forget? This page attempts to solve that problem.

## What was that giant slide called?

It was a very big, straight, undulating slide with several parallel lanes (so not a helmet smelter).

It was at Prestatyn in the 1970s. I always think it was called the Ummagumma, which seems to be some kind of childhood confusion related to Pink Floyd's album (which my dad owned) and the word "Undulator" (although that's not what the slide was called - but it did undulate).

Anyway, it was called the Astroglide.

It's [mentioned here](https://coasterpedia.net/wiki/Astroglide_(Ffrith_Beach)) in Coasterpedia. Here's a picture of an equivalent slide at Margate:
