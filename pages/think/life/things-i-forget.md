## What is this page all about?

There are certain questions that I often find myself asking, but someow never remember the answers. The problem I've always had whenever I rediscover those answers is... where can I make a note of this so that I'll know where to come the next time I forget? This page attempts to solve that problem.

## What's that birdsong that I hear every springtime - alternating notes in a minor third?

## What was that giant slide called?

It was a very big, straight, undulating slide with several parallel lanes (so not a helmet smelter).

It was at Prestatyn in the 1970s. I always think it was called the Ummagumma, which seems to be some kind of childhood confusion related to Pink Floyd's album (which my dad owned) and the word "Undulator" (although that's not what the slide was called - but it did undulate).

Anyway, it was called the Astroglide.

It's [mentioned here](https://coasterpedia.net/wiki/Astroglide_(Ffrith_Beach)) in Coasterpedia. Here's a picture of an equivalent slide at Margate:

Geoff had a bat survey done, and I *thought* he told me they were hirondelle bats, but that doesn't seem to be a thing according to Google (although there seems to be a French term "hirondelle de nuit" which translates as "night swallow" and means bat??). Maybe I misheard him or he misremembered?

The owls there now (2021) are tawny owls, aka screech owls.

The Camberwell Carrot scene in [Withnail and I](https://sfy.ru/transcript/withnail_ts):

Danny: "Sit down man, find your neutral space. You have done something to your brain. You have made it high. If I lay 10 mills of diazipan on you, you will do something else to your brain, you will make it low. Why trust one drug rather than the other? That's politics ain't it."
