## What is this page all about?

There are certain questions that I often find myself asking, but someow never remember the answers. The problem I've always had whenever I rediscover those answers is... where can I make a note of this so that I'll know where to come the next time I forget? This page attempts to solve that problem.

## What's that birdsong that I hear every springtime - alternating notes in a minor third?

## What was that giant slide called?

It was a very big, straight, undulating slide with several parallel lanes (so not a helmet smelter).

It was at Prestatyn in the 1970s. I always think it was called the Ummagumma, which seems to be some kind of childhood confusion related to Pink Floyd's album (which my dad owned) and the word "Undulator" (although that's not what the slide was called - but it did undulate).

Anyway, it was called the Astroglide.

It's [mentioned here](https://coasterpedia.net/wiki/Astroglide_(Ffrith_Beach)) in Coasterpedia. Here's a picture of an equivalent slide at Margate:

Geoff had a bat survey done, and I *thought* he told me they were hirondelle bats, but that doesn't seem to be a thing according to Google (although there seems to be a French term "hirondelle de nuit" which translates as "night swallow" and means bat??). Maybe I misheard him or he misremembered?

## What's that economics / economist's story about the cheap jewellery?

- The one that illustrates why it's worth charging more.

The one about the jewellery store owner who was having difficulty selling a particular range of high quality, reasonably priced turquoise items. 

She tried moving them to a more visible location and getting the staff to push them heavily, but it wasn't working. In the end, on her way out to a vacation, she left a happy scribbled note for her assistant, saying "everything in this display case, price x 1/2".

When she came back, she found the entire display cabinet had sold out. So halving the price worked! But when she spoke to her assistant it turned out he'd misread her note and thought it said "x 2". So he'd _doubled_ the price.

And now that it was more expensive, it signalled high quality to people just wanting to buy a gift of a particular quality, and assuming the price told them how high quality it was.
