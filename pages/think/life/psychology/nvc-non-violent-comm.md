## Quotes

- "As NVC replaces our old patterns of defending, withdrawing, or attacking in the face of judgment and criticism, we come to perceive ourselves and others, as well as our intentions and relationships, in a new light."
  - "We perceive relationships in a new light when we use NVC to hear our own deeper needs and those of others."
- "We pay dearly when people meet our needs out of fear, guilt or shame"
- "The recognition that we have chosen to use our power to serve life and have done so successfully brings us the genuine joy of celebrating ourselves in a way that approval from others can never offer."

## Summary

- Four components of the NVC model: 
  - 1. observations 
    - First, we observe what is actually happening in a situation: what are we observing others saying or doing that is either enriching or not enriching our life?
  - 2. feelings 
    - Next, we state how we feel when we observe this action: are we hurt, scared, joyful, amused, irritated?
  - 3. needs 
    - And thirdly, we say what needs of ours are connected to the feelings we have identified. 
    - Connect your feeling with your need
      - “I feel … because I need …”
  - 4. requests
    - This fourth component addresses what we are wanting from the other person that would enrich our lives or make life more wonderful for us.
    - When we simply express our feelings, it may not be clear to the listener what we want them to do.
    - They are REQUESTS, not DEMANDS
      - Requests may sound like demands when unaccompanied by the speaker’s feelings and needs.
    - Make requests in clear, positive, concrete action language to reveal what you really want.
    - To tell if it’s a demand or a request, observe what the speaker does if the request is not complied with.
      - It’s a demand if the speaker then criticizes or judges.
      - It’s a demand if the speaker then lays a guilt trip.
      - It’s a request if the speaker then shows empathy toward the other person’s needs.
- Give and receive
  - Two parts of NVC: 
    - 1. expressing honestly through the four components 
    - 2. receiving empathically through the four components
- In difficult exchanges... 
  - Start by empathisizing
  - If they can't express their feelings and needs, try to do it for them
  - Listen to what people are needing rather than what they are thinking.
  - Reflect back messages that are emotionally charged.
  - Ask them if you've got it right
  - Paraphrase only when it contributes to greater compassion and understanding.
    - When hearing themselves reflected back, people are likely to be sensitive to the slightest hint of criticism or sarcasm.
  - Behind intimidating messages are merely people appealing to us to meet their needs.
    - A difficult message becomes an opportunity to enrich someone’s life.
  - When our own pain prevents us from empathizing with others
    - It may be necessary to provide ourselves with some “emergency first aid” empathy by listening to what’s going on in ourselves with the same quality of presence and attention that we offer to others. 
      - If we become skilled at giving ourselves empathy, we often experience in just a few seconds a natural release of energy that then enables us to be present with the other person.
    - We may have to share our own pain
    - We may have to remove ourselves from the situation
  - Empathize with silence by listening for the feelings and needs behind it.
    - this also allows you to play back what you've guessed, and hopefully get confirmation / clarification
- When you try to communicate your own feelings and needs, ask them to play it back
  - We make clear that we’re not testing their listening skills, but checking out whether we’ve expressed ourselves clearly.
  - Express appreciation when your listener tries to meet your request for a reflection.
  - Empathize with the listener who doesn’t want to reflect back.
- Avoid judging
  - Rather than judging others, try to empathize with them instead
  - Comparisons are judgments
  - Compliments can also be judgments!
- Avoid "shoulds"
  - We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice.
  - If the person we are judging happens to be ourselves, what we are saying is, “I myself am not behaving in harmony with my own needs.” 
  - We want to take action out of the desire to contribute to life rather than out of fear, guilt, shame, or obligation.
  - When the sole energy that motivates us is simply to make life wonderful for others and ourselves, then even hard work has an element of play in it. 
  - See the [[#EXERCISE Translating “Have to” to “Choose to”|Have to => Choose to exercise]]
- Don't beat yourself up
  - You can mourn actions you took that you regret
  - NVC self-forgiveness: connecting with the need we were trying to meet when we took the action that we now regret.
- Avoid doing things for approval
  - When we do things solely in the spirit of enhancing life, we will find others appreciating us. Their appreciation, however, is only a feedback mechanism confirming that our efforts had the intended effect. 
  - The recognition that we have chosen to use our power to serve life and have done so successfully brings us the genuine joy of celebrating ourselves in a way that approval from others can never offer.
- Observe without evaluating
  - Avoid words like always, never, ever, whenever, frequently, seldom when observing
- Distinguish feelings from thoughts
  - "I feel that" and "I feel you" and "I feel inadequate" and "I feel unimportant" are not feelings
  - They are pseudo feelings
  - "I feel that you..." can actually be a way of identifying a pseudo feeling and turning it into a statement. Not a feeling any more!
- After we express ourselves vulnerably, we often want to know 
  - 1. what the listener is feeling;
  - 2. what the listener is thinking;
  - 3. whether the listener would be willing to take a particular action.
- What others do is the stimulus for our feelings, not the cause
  - Expressing genuine requests also requires an awareness of our objective. If our objective is only to change people and their behavior or to get our way, then NVC is not an appropriate tool. 
  - Our objective is a relationship based on honesty and empathy.
- When someone gives us a negative message, whether verbally or nonverbally, we have four options as to how to receive it. Aim for options 3 and 4.
  - 1. blame ourselves.
  - 2. blame others.
  - 3. sense our own feelings and needs.
  - 4. sense others’ feelings and needs.
  - You can use the components of NVC to tune in to the feelings and needs of those close to you in contrast to either 
    - 1. blaming yourself by taking the message personally, or 
    - 2. blaming and judging them.
- When asking for information, first express our own feelings and needs.
  - Thus, instead of asking someone, “What did I do?” we might say, “I’m frustrated because I’d like to be clearer about what you are referring to. Would you be willing to tell me what I’ve done that leads you to see me in this way?”
- The Pain of Expressing Our Needs versus the Pain of Not Expressing Our Needs
  - It's OK to express your needs
- Ask before offering advice or reassurance.
  - Believing we have to “fix” situations and make others feel better prevents us from being present.
  - Allow others the opportunity to fully express themselves before turning your attention to solutions or requests for relief.
- Using Empathy to Defuse Danger
  - Rather than put your “but” in the face of an angry person, empathize.
  - When we listen for feelings and needs, we no longer see people as monsters.
- Steps to expressing anger: 
  - 1. Stop. Breathe. 
  - 2. Identify our judgmental thoughts. 
    - Stay conscious of the violent thoughts that arise in our minds, without judging them.
    - Practice translating each judgment into an unmet need.
  - 3. Identify the other person's feelings and needs
    - When we hear another person’s feelings and needs, we recognize our common humanity.
  - 4. Connect with our needs.
  - 5. Express our feelings and unmet needs, without judging the other person.
    - People do not hear our pain when they believe they are at fault.
- Compliments are often judgments — however positive - of others.
  - Express appreciation to celebrate, not to manipulate.
  - The Three Components of Appreciation
    - 1. the actions that have contributed to our well-being 
    - 2. the particular needs of ours that have been fulfilled 
    - 3. the pleasureful feelings engendered by the fulfillment of those needs
  - "I’ve tried to be more aware of what others around me are doing that enriches my life, and to hone my skills in expressing this appreciation."
- Take your time
  - We may feel awkward deviating from the habitual behaviors that our conditioning has rendered automatic, but if our intention is to consciously live life in harmony with our values, then we’ll want to take our time.

### Four components of the NVC model

- Chapter 1
- Four components of the NVC model: 
  - 1. observations 
  - 2. feelings 
  - 3. needs 
  - 4. requests
- 1. Observations
  - The concrete actions we _observe_ that affect our well-being
  - First, we observe what is actually happening in a situation: what are we observing others saying or doing that is either enriching or not enriching our life?
  - The trick is to be able to articulate this observation without introducing any judgment or evaluation — to simply say what people are doing that we either like or don’t like. 
- 2. feelings
  - How we _feel_ in relation to what we observe
  - Next, we state how we feel when we observe this action: are we hurt, scared, joyful, amused, irritated?
- 3. needs
  - The _needs_, values, desires, etc. that create our feelings
  - And thirdly, we say what needs of ours are connected to the feelings we have identified. 
  - For example, a mother might express these three pieces to her teenage son by saying, “Felix*, when I see two balls of soiled socks under the coffee table and another three next to the TV, I feel irritated because I am needing more order in the rooms that we share in common.” 
    - *Not my choice of example name! That's in the book.
- All the first three
  - An awareness of these three components is present when we use NVC to clearly and honestly express how we are. 
- 4. requests
  - The concrete actions we _request_ in order to enrich our lives
  - The mother in the example above would follow immediately with the fourth component — a very specific request: “Would you be willing to put your socks in your room or in the washing machine?” 
  - This fourth component addresses what we are wanting from the other person that would enrich our lives or make life more wonderful for us.

### Give and receive

- Chapter 1
- Give and receive
  - Two parts of NVC: 
    - 1. expressing honestly through the four components 
    - 2. receiving empathically through the four components
  - Part of NVC is to express these four pieces of information very clearly, whether verbally or by other means. 
  - The other part of this communication consists of receiving the same four pieces of information from others.
- Can receive first
  - If someone is angry, start by hearing what they're telling you
  - This might involve playing their words back to them using the language of feelings and needs
  - eg "So, I'm hearing that you feel X because you need Y?"
  - "I didn’t agree or disagree. I received his words, not as attacks, but as gifts from a fellow human willing to share his soul and deep vulnerabilities with me."

### Avoid judgements

- Chapter 2
- Certain ways of communicating alienate us from our natural state of compassion.
- Analyses of others are actually tragic expressions of our own needs and values.
- They are tragic because when we express our values and needs in this form, we increase defensiveness and resistance among the very people whose behaviors are of concern to us.
- Our attention is focused on classifying, analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness rather than on what we and others need and are not getting.
- It is important here not to confuse value judgments and moralistic judgments. All of us make value judgments as to the qualities we value in life; for example, we might value honesty, freedom, or peace.
- Classifying and judging people promotes violence.
- Comparisons are a form of judgment.
- Judgments of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet needs. 
- This also applies to judgments we make of ourselves. See [connecting compassionately with ourselves](<#connecting compassionately with ourselves>)

### Avoid denial of responsibility

- Chapter 2
- Another kind of life-alienating communication is denial of responsibility.
- We deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to factors outside ourselves: Vague, impersonal forces — “I cleaned my room because I had to.”
- We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice.
- We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think, and feel.

### Avoid Life-Alienating Communication

- Chapter 2
- Communicating our desires as demands is yet another form of language that blocks compassion.
- We can never make people do anything.
- Thinking based on “who deserves what” blocks compassionate communication.
- Life-alienating communication has deep philosophical and political roots.

### Observe without evaluating

- Chapter 3
- When we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism.
- Distinguishing Observations From Evaluations
- The words always, never, ever, whenever, etc. express evaluations when used in the following ways: 
  - Whenever I have observed Jack on the phone, he has spoken for at least thirty minutes. 
  - I cannot recall your ever writing to me.
- Words like frequently and seldom can also contribute to confusing observation with evaluation.

### The Heavy Cost of Unexpressed Feelings

- Chapter 4
- For families, the toll is severe when members are unable to communicate emotions.
- Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts.
- Feelings versus Non-Feelings
  - A common confusion, generated by the English language, is our use of the word feel without actually expressing a feeling. For example, in the sentence, “I feel I didn’t get a fair deal”
  - In general, feelings are not being clearly expressed when the word feel is followed by: 
    - Words such as that, like, as if:  (I feel that...)
    - The pronouns I, you, he, she, they, it:  (I feel you...)
    - Names or nouns referring to people: (I feel Clare...)
- Distinguish feelings from thoughts.
- Distinguish between what we feel and what we think we are.
  - "I feel inadequate as a guitar player.”
- Distinguish between what we feel and how we think others react or behave toward us.
  - "I feel unimportant to the people with whom I work.”
- In expressing our feelings, it helps to use words that refer to specific emotions, rather than words that are vague or general.
  - See list of words towards end of chapter 4

### Taking Responsibility for Our Feelings

- Chapter 5
- What others do may be the stimulus of our feelings, but not the cause.
- When someone gives us a negative message, whether verbally or nonverbally, we have four options as to how to receive it.
  - 1. blame ourselves.
  - 2. blame others.
  - 3. sense our own feelings and needs.
    - By focusing attention on our own feelings and needs, we become conscious that our current feeling of hurt derives from a need for our efforts to be recognized.
  - 4. sense others’ feelings and needs.
    - a fourth option on receiving a negative message is to shine the light of consciousness on the other person’s feelings and needs as they are currently expressed. We might for example ask, “Are you feeling hurt because you need more consideration for your preferences?”
- Connect your feeling with your need
  - “I feel … because I need …”
- Distinguish between giving from the heart and being motivated by guilt.
  - The basic mechanism of motivating by guilt is to attribute the responsibility for one’s own feelings to others.

### The Needs at the Roots of Feelings

- Chapter 5
- If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them met.
- The Pain of Expressing Our Needs versus the Pain of Not Expressing Our Needs
  - In a world where we’re often judged harshly for identifying and revealing our needs, doing so can be very frightening. 
  - Women, in particular, are susceptible to criticism. For centuries, the image of the loving woman has been associated with sacrifice and the denial of one’s own needs to take care of others.
  - These women, if they ask for what they want, will often do so in a way that both reflects and reinforces the beliefs that they have no genuine right to their needs and that their needs are unimportant.
- If we don’t value our needs, others may not either.

### From Emotional Slavery to Emotional Liberation

- Chapter 5
- In our development toward a state of emotional liberation, most of us experience three stages in the way we relate to others.
- Stage 1. Emotional slavery
  - We see ourselves responsible for others’ feelings.
  - We think we must constantly strive to keep everyone happy. If they don’t appear happy, we feel responsible and compelled to do something about it.
- Second stage: The obnoxious stage. 
  - We feel angry; we no longer want to be responsible for others’ feelings.
- Third stage: Emotional liberation. 
  - We take responsibility for our intentions and actions.

### Using Positive Action Language

- Chapter 6
- Use positive language when making requests.
  - She had successfully communicated to him what she did not want — his spending so much time at work — but had failed to request what she did want. Encouraged to reword her request, she thought a minute and said, “I wish I had told him that I would like him to spend at least one evening a week at home with the children and me.”
- Making requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want.
- Vague language contributes to internal confusion.
- Making Requests Consciously
  - When we simply express our feelings, it may not be clear to the listener what we want them to do.
- We are often not conscious of what we are requesting.
- Requests may sound like demands when unaccompanied by the speaker’s feelings and needs.
- The clearer we are about what we want, the more likely it is that we’ll get it.
- To make sure the message we sent is the message that’s received, ask the listener to reflect it back.
  - Express appreciation when your listener tries to meet your request for a reflection.
  - When we first begin asking others to reflect back what they hear us say, it may feel awkward and strange because such requests are rarely made.
  - To prevent such responses, we can explain to people ahead of time why we may sometimes ask them to reflect back our words. We make clear that we’re not testing their listening skills, but checking out whether we’ve expressed ourselves clearly.
  - Empathize with the listener who doesn’t want to reflect back.

### Requesting Honesty

- Chapter 6
- After we’ve openly expressed ourselves and received the understanding we want, we’re often eager to know the other person’s reaction to what we’ve said.
- Usually the honesty we would like to receive takes one of three directions. After we express ourselves vulnerably, we often want to know 
- 1. what the listener is feeling;
  - Sometimes we’d like to know the feelings that are stimulated by what we said, and the reasons for those feelings. We might request this by asking, “I would like you to tell me how you feel about what I just said, and your reasons for feeling as you do.”
- 2. what the listener is thinking;
  - “I’d like you to tell me if you predict that my proposal would be successful, and if not, what you believe would prevent its success,”
- 3. whether the listener would be willing to take a particular action.
  - “I’d like you to tell me if you would be willing to postpone our meeting for one week.”
- In a group, much time is wasted when speakers aren’t certain what response they’re wanting.

### Requests versus Demands

- Chapter 6
- When the other person hears a demand from us, they see two options: to submit or to rebel.
  - The more we have in the past blamed, punished, or “laid guilt trips” on others when they haven’t responded to our requests, the higher the likelihood that our requests will now be heard as demands.
- To tell if it’s a demand or a request, observe what the speaker does if the request is not complied with.
  - It’s a demand if the speaker then criticizes or judges.
  - It’s a demand if the speaker then lays a guilt trip.
  - It’s a request if the speaker then shows empathy toward the other person’s needs.
- Defining Our Objective When Making Requests
- Expressing genuine requests also requires an awareness of our objective. If our objective is only to change people and their behavior or to get our way, then NVC is not an appropriate tool. 
  - Our objective is a relationship based on honesty and empathy.

### Receiving Empathically

- Chapter 7
- The two parts of NVC: 
  - 1. expressing honestly 
  - 2. receiving empathically
- Empathy: emptying our mind and listening with our whole being
- Ask before offering advice or reassurance.
- Common behaviors that prevent us from being sufficiently present to connect empathically with others:
  - Advising: “I think you should … ” “How come you didn’t … ?”
  - One-upping: “That’s nothing; wait’ll you hear what happened to me.” 
  - Educating: “This could turn into a very positive experience for you if you just … ” 
  - Consoling: “It wasn’t your fault; you did the best you could.” 
  - Story-telling: “That reminds me of the time … ” 
  - Shutting down: “Cheer up. Don’t feel so bad.” 
  - Sympathizing: “Oh, you poor thing … ” 
  - Interrogating: “When did this begin?” 
  - Explaining: “I would have called but … ” 
  - Correcting: “That’s not how it happened.”
- Believing we have to “fix” situations and make others feel better prevents us from being present.
- Intellectual understanding blocks empathy.
- Listening for Feelings and Needs
- In NVC, no matter what words people use to express themselves, we listen for their observations, feelings, needs, and requests.
- You can use the components of NVC to tune in to the feelings and needs of those family members in contrast to either (1) blaming yourself by taking the message personally, or (2) blaming and judging them.
- Listen to what people are needing rather than what they are thinking.
- When asking for information, first express our own feelings and needs.
  - Thus, instead of asking someone, “What did I do?” we might say, “I’m frustrated because I’d like to be clearer about what you are referring to. Would you be willing to tell me what I’ve done that leads you to see me in this way?”
- Reflect back messages that are emotionally charged.
- Paraphrase only when it contributes to greater compassion and understanding.
  - When we paraphrase, the tone of voice we use is highly important. When hearing themselves reflected back, people are likely to be sensitive to the slightest hint of criticism or sarcasm.
- Behind intimidating messages are merely people appealing to us to meet their needs.
  - A difficult message becomes an opportunity to enrich someone’s life.
- I recommend allowing others the opportunity to fully express themselves before turning our attention to solutions or requests for relief.
  - By maintaining our attention on what’s going on within others, we offer them a chance to fully explore and express their interior selves.
  - When we stay with empathy, we allow speakers to touch deeper levels of themselves.
  - We know a speaker has received adequate empathy when (1) we sense a release of tension, or (2) the flow of words comes to a halt.

### When Pain Blocks Our Ability to Empathize

- Chapter 7
- It is impossible for us to give something to another if we don’t have it ourselves.
  - We need empathy to give empathy.
- It may be necessary to provide ourselves with some “emergency first aid” empathy by listening to what’s going on in ourselves with the same quality of presence and attention that we offer to others. 
  - If we become skilled at giving ourselves empathy, we often experience in just a few seconds a natural release of energy that then enables us to be present with the other person.
- Other choices:
  - We can scream — nonviolently.
    - “Hey, I’m in a lot of pain! Right now I really do not want to deal with your fighting! I just want some peace and quiet!”
  - We can physically remove ourselves from the situation. 
    - We give ourselves time out and the opportunity to acquire the empathy we need to return in a different frame of mind.

### Empathy That Heals

- Chapter 8
- Empathy allows us “to reperceive [our] world in a new way and to go on.”
- "I don’t want you to do anything; I just want you to listen."
- It’s harder to empathize with those who appear to possess more power, status, or resources.
- The more we empathize with the other party, the safer we feel.
- We “say a lot” by listening for other people’s feelings and needs.
- Using Empathy to Defuse Danger
  - Rather than put your “but” in the face of an angry person, empathize.
- When we listen for feelings and needs, we no longer see people as monsters.
- Empathizing with someone’s “no” protects us from taking it personally.
- Empathy to Revive a Lifeless Conversation
  - the best time to interrupt is when we’ve heard one word more than we want to hear.
  - The longer we wait, the harder it is to be civil when we do step in.
  - To bring a conversation back to life: interrupt with empathy.
  - “I’m feeling impatient because I’d like to be more connected with you, but our conversation isn’t creating the kind of connection I’m wanting. I’d like to know if the conversation we’ve been having is meeting your needs, and if so, what needs of yours are being met through it.”
- What bores the listener bores the speaker too.
  - Speakers prefer that listeners interrupt rather than pretend to listen.
- Empathize with silence by listening for the feelings and needs behind it.
  - “I’m sensing from your response to my crying that you’re feeling disgusted, and you’d prefer to have someone more in control of his feelings consulting with your staff.”
  - “No, not at all. I was just thinking of how my wife wishes I could cry.”

### Connecting Compassionately With Ourselves

- Chapter 9
- NVC’s most important use may be in developing self-compassion.
- We use NVC to evaluate ourselves in ways that engender growth rather than self-hatred.
- In our language there is a word with enormous power to create shame and guilt: "should"
- Human beings, when hearing any kind of demand, tend to resist because it threatens our autonomy—our strong need for choice. We have this reaction to tyranny even when it’s internal tyranny in the form of a should.
- Avoid shoulding yourself!
- Self-judgments, like all judgments, are tragic expressions of unmet needs.
  - If the person we are judging happens to be ourselves, what we are saying is, “I myself am not behaving in harmony with my own needs.” 
  - I am convinced that if we learn to evaluate ourselves in terms of whether and how well our needs are being fulfilled, we are much more likely to learn from the evaluation.
- NVC Mourning
  - connecting with the feelings and unmet needs stimulated by past actions we now regret.
  - we can train ourselves to recognize judgmental self-talk and to immediately focus our attention on the underlying needs.
  - In response to “Look, you just messed up again!”, we can quickly stop and ask ourselves, “What unmet need of mine is being expressed through this moralistic judgment?”
- We follow up on the process of mourning with self-forgiveness.
  - NVC self-forgiveness: connecting with the need we were trying to meet when we took the action that we now regret.
- We are compassionate with ourselves when we are able to embrace all parts of ourselves and recognize the needs and values expressed by each part. [[#EXERCISE Translating “Have to” to “Choose to”]]

### Don’t Do Anything That Isn’t Play!

- Chapter 9
- Remove all the "shoulds"
- We want to take action out of the desire to contribute to life rather than out of fear, guilt, shame, or obligation.
- I earnestly believe that an important form of self-compassion is to make choices motivated purely by our desire to contribute to life rather than out of fear, guilt, shame, duty, or obligation. 
- When we are conscious of the life-enriching purpose behind an action we take, when the sole energy that motivates us is simply to make life wonderful for others and ourselves, then even hard work has an element of play in it. 
- Correspondingly, an otherwise joyful activity performed out of obligation, duty, fear, guilt, or shame will lose its joy and eventually engender resistance.

### EXERCISE: Translating “Have to” to “Choose to”

- Chapter 9
- (My attempt at this exercise is in clare-tech)
- Step 1 
  - What do you do in your life that you don’t experience as playful? List on a piece of paper all those things that you tell yourself you have to do. 
  - List any activity you dread but do anyway because you perceive yourself to have no choice.
- Step 2 
  - After completing your list, clearly acknowledge to yourself that you are doing these things because you choose to do them, not because you have to. 
  - Insert the words “I choose to … ” in front of each item you listed.
- Step 3 
  - After having acknowledged that you choose to do a particular activity, get in touch with the intention behind your choice by completing the statement, I choose to … because I want ….
- With every choice you make, be conscious of what need it serves.
- Cultivating Awareness of the Energy Behind Our Actions
- For some items on your list, you might uncover one or several of the following motivations:
- 1. FOR MONEY
  - Money is not a “need” as we define it in NVC; it is one of countless strategies that may be selected to address a need.
- 2. FOR APPROVAL
  - Like money, approval from others is a form of extrinsic reward. Our culture has educated us to hunger for reward.
  - I find it tragic that we work so hard to buy love and assume that we must deny ourselves and do for others in order to be liked. 
  - In fact, when we do things solely in the spirit of enhancing life, we will find others appreciating us. Their appreciation, however, is only a feedback mechanism confirming that our efforts had the intended effect. 
  - The recognition that we have chosen to use our power to serve life and have done so successfully brings us the genuine joy of celebrating ourselves in a way that approval from others can never offer.
- 3. TO ESCAPE PUNISHMENT
  - It's better if you can fnd another reason
- 4. TO AVOID SHAME
  - If we do something stimulated solely by the urge to avoid shame, we will generally end up detesting it.
- 5. TO AVOID GUILT
  - There is a world of difference between doing something for others in order to avoid guilt and doing it out of a clear awareness of our own need to contribute to the happiness of other human beings. 
  - The first is a world filled with misery; the second is a world filled with play.
- Be conscious of actions motivated by the desire for money or approval, and by fear, shame, or guilt. Know the price you pay for them.
  - The most dangerous of all behaviors may consist of doing things “because we’re supposed to.”
- After examining the list of items you have generated, you may decide to stop doing certain things
  - As radical as it may seem, it is possible to do things only out of play.

### Expressing Anger Fully

- Chapter 10
- hitting, blaming, hurting others — whether physically or emotionally — are all superficial expressions of what is going on within us when we are angry.
- Distinguishing Stimulus From Cause
  - The first step to fully expressing anger in NVC is to divorce the other person from any responsibility for our anger.
  - We are never angry because of what others say or do.
- To motivate by guilt, mix up stimulus and cause.
- whenever we are angry with someone, we are finding fault — we are choosing to play God by judging or blaming the other person for being wrong or deserving punishment. I would like to suggest that this is the cause of anger.
- Rather than going up to our head to make a mental analysis of wrongness regarding somebody, we choose to connect to the life that is within us. This life energy is most palpable and accessible when we focus on what we need in each moment.
- I see all anger as a result of life-alienating, violence-provoking thinking. At the core of all anger is a need that is not being fulfilled. Thus anger can be valuable if we use it as an alarm clock to wake us up — to realize we have a need that isn’t being met and that we are thinking in a way that makes it unlikely to be met.
- Anger co-opts our energy by directing it toward punishing people rather than meeting our needs. Instead of engaging in “righteous indignation,” I recommend connecting empathically with our own needs or those of others.
- Steps to expressing anger: 
  - 1. Stop. Breathe. 
  - 2. Identify our judgmental thoughts. 
  - 3. Connect with our needs.
  - 4. Express our feelings and unmet needs.
- In most cases, however, another step needs to take place before we can expect the other party to connect with what is going on in us. 
  - Because it will often be difficult for others to receive our feelings and needs in such situations, if we want them to hear us we would need first to empathize with them. 
  - The more we empathize with what leads them to behave in the ways that are not meeting our needs, the more likely it is that they will be able to reciprocate afterwards.
  - The more we hear them, the more they’ll hear us.
- Stay conscious of the violent thoughts that arise in our minds, without judging them.
  - eg the story of him in the back of a taxi with an antisemite
  - He was angry, but he asked a bunch of questions until he could find their common humanity
- When we hear another person’s feelings and needs, we recognize our common humanity.
  - Our need is for the other person to truly hear our pain.
  - People do not hear our pain when they believe they are at fault.
- Practice translating each judgment into an unmet need.
- Take your time
  - We may feel awkward deviating from the habitual behaviors that our conditioning has rendered automatic, but if our intention is to consciously live life in harmony with our values, then we’ll want to take our time.

### Conflict Resolution and Mediation

- Chapter 11
- Creating a connection between people is the most important thing.
- Avoid the use of language that implies wrongness.
- Intellectual analysis is often received as criticism.
- Learn to hear needs regardless of how people express them.
- Criticism and diagnosis get in the way of peaceful resolution of conflicts.
- People often need empathy before they are able to hear what is being said.
- Using Present and Positive Action Language to Resolve Conflict
  - Action language requires the use of action verbs.
- Maintaining respect is a key element in successful conflict resolution.
- the importance of not hearing “no” as rejection.
  - When they say “no,” they’re saying they have a need that keeps them from saying “yes” to what we are asking.
- The objective is not to get the parties to do what we want them to do.
- Keep Track: Follow the Bouncing Ball 
  - When we are mediating, we have to “keep score” by paying careful attention to what has been said, making sure both parties have the opportunity to express their needs, listen to the other person’s needs, and make requests.
  - Keep the Conversation in the Present
  - Keep Things Moving
- Use role-play to speed up the mediation process.
  - To keep them from spending time telling the same stories over and over, I asked one of the brothers if I could play his role; then I would switch and play the part of the other brother.
  - Though the conflict had persisted for years, with lawyers on both sides working unsuccessfully to come to agreement, it became simple to resolve once the brothers heard each other’s pain and needs as revealed through the role-playing.
  - If I had waited for both of them to tell their stories, the resolution would have taken much longer.
- Interrupting
  - when both sides are screaming or talking at the same time, I insert myself: “Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me!” I repeat this as loudly and as often as necessary until I regain their attention.
- Informal Mediation: Sticking Our Nose in Other People’s Business
  - When we witness behaviors that raise concern in us—unless it is a situation that calls for the protective use of force as described in Chapter 12—the first thing we do is to empathize with the needs of the person who is behaving in the way we dislike.
  - We need to be well practiced at hearing the need in any message.

### The Protective Use of Force

- Chapter 12
- When the Use of Force Is Unavoidable
- The intention behind the protective use of force is only to protect, not to punish, blame, or condemn.
- Punitive force
  - Fear of corporal punishment obscures children’s awareness of the compassion underlying their parents’ demands.
  - Punishment also includes judgmental labeling and the withholding of privileges.
  - When we fear punishment, we focus on consequences, not on our own values. Fear of punishment diminishes self-esteem and goodwill.
  - Two Questions That Reveal the Limitations of Punishment
    - Question 1: What do I want this person to do? 
    - Question 2: What do I want this person’s reasons to be for doing it?

### Liberating Ourselves and Counseling Others

- Chapter 13
- We can liberate ourselves from cultural conditioning.
- Resolving Internal Conflicts
  - The ability to hear our own feelings and needs and empathize with them can free us from depression.
- Focus on what we want to do rather than what went wrong.
- Defuse stress by hearing our own feelings and needs.
- Defuse stress by empathizing with others.
- Replacing Diagnosis With NVC
  - I thus began to experiment by replacing clinical language with the language of NVC. Instead of interpreting what my clients were saying in line with the personality theories I had studied, I made myself present to their words and listened empathically. Instead of diagnosing them, I revealed what was going on within myself.
  - I empathized with clients instead of interpreting them; I revealed myself instead of diagnosing them.

### Expressing Appreciation in Nonviolent Communication

- Chapter 14
- Compliments are often judgments — however positive - of others.
- Express appreciation to celebrate, not to manipulate.
- The Three Components of Appreciation
  - 1. the actions that have contributed to our well-being 
  - 2. the particular needs of ours that have been fulfilled 
  - 3. the pleasureful feelings engendered by the fulfillment of those needs
- Saying “thank you” in NVC: “This is what you did; this is what I feel; this is the need of mine that was met.”
- Receiving Appreciation
  - Receive appreciation without feelings of superiority or false humility.
- The Hunger for Appreciation
  - We tend to notice what’s wrong rather than what’s right.
  - "I’ve tried to be more aware of what others around me are doing that enriches my life, and to hone my skills in expressing this appreciation."
- Conventional compliments often take the form of judgments, however positive, and are sometimes intended to manipulate the behavior of others. 
  - NVC encourages the expression of appreciation solely for celebration.
