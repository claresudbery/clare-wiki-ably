## How to do a good job of silicone sealant / silicon sealant

- [This video](https://youtu.be/nbKcZLSbr3Q?si=9P4wUWxwcLReqbhq) is a good quick non-nonsense tutorial
- Quick summary:
  - If doing the edge of a bath, fill the bath with water. 
    - This is because when the bath is full of water, that creates extra weight which pulls the bath away from the wall and increases / moves the gap
  - Use masking tape to create a narrow channel where you want the silicone to go
  - Have turps / white spirit handy, in a spray bottle
    - Doesn't have to be exactly turps
  - Cut a small hole in the nozzle, only just enough to fill the gap
    - If you have multiple seams to do of different sizes, do narrowest ones first
  - Hold the dispenser nozzle at a 45 degree angle
  - Pull away from you, don't push forwards
    - as in, start at a far end and move backwards, pulling the silicone out towards you
  - Do one seam at a time
  - Move quickly. As soon as you've finished a seam, spray it with turps and then smooth it out
  - It doesn't matter if the first application isn't smooth and neat - that's what you do after spraying the turps
  - Use a shaping / smoothing tool to get a neat finish
    - Drag it smoothly along the seam, ideally in one motion
  - Remove the masking tape immediately afterwards
    - Pull up and away at a 45 degree angle
    - ...pulling _away_ from the seam
