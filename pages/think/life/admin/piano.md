## Nasty piano overtones / harmonics

## Digital pianos / electric pianos

- Summarised from Forsyths' site [here](https://www.forsyths.co.uk/content/53-how-to-choose-a-digital-piano)
    - Looks like it's a little out of date though, as the actual models recommended are mostly not on the site
- Most have 88 key weighted keyboard and sample sound of grand piano
- Three types:
    - Full cabinet
    - *** Portable stage piano
    - Designed to look like real piano, eg grand
- Key action:
    - Weghted means key does not spring straight back after presing. Feels more like real piano. Easier to play expressively.
    - Kawai Grand Feel
        - wooden keys, physical mechanism similar to real piano, needs regulation / setup to stay in condition
- Sound quality
    - Two elements: amplification and sound generation
    - They have power ratings - more powerful is better. Not just about how loud. You want it to recreate the dynamic range available on real piano.
    - Power also affects sound quality. Higher power will get better sound quality when you play a loud bass note.
    - The details of how the samples grand piano sounds are reproduced is co,plex, but better ones have more powerful processors.
- Choices
    -  Kawai CN29 is a great entry level model by one of the world market leaders and is an ideal first piano
        - CA49 is similar but has wooden key mechanism
    - Stage pianos:
        - Casio CDP-S100 is a entry level instrument that has really impressed us for its price point
        - For a little more money the Yamaha P45 is a great stage piano with a lovely tone for its price.
        - Kawai ES920
            - quality piano that is portable
            - most of the benefits of a Kawai cabinet piano in a performance friendly package
            - lots of connectivity for amplification and using with a computer
            - built in speakers for practice that can be disabled when the instrument is used through external amplification
- Questions
    - Internal amp?
    - Ability to connect to external amp?
    - Ability to connect to computer?
    - Carrying case?

# Embodiment

- The book (about embodiment) is called "What Every Pianist Needs to Know About The Body" by Dr. Thomas Mark
- I have a copy on my Kindle
- This is a good unaffiliated link for the book: https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=60548.0
- Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/What-Every-Pianist-Needs-About/dp/1579992064
- I made lots of notes in phone notes - see “The Piano application notes”
