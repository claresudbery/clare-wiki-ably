## Bicarb vs baking powder vs baking soda

Baking *soda* is same as bicarb, or bicarbonate of soda. Baking *powder* is not the same but will do if that is all you have. Neither are the same as borax.

    - My notes on that recipe:
        - Mash the avocado in the bowl first before adding the rest - then just chuck all ingredients on top
        - Add about 4 cubic inches of fresh root ginger
        - Don't bother with the onion. But if you do, quarter of a cup is approx quarter of a normal onion-sized onion.
        - Add a couple of splashes of lime juice
        - Add three shakes of tabasco
        - For salt quantity, 6 grinds from a salt grinder works well.
