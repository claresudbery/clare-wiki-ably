## Fixing leaks to pipes under sink

- Notes: 
    - you need a rubber gasket (= washer in UK) 
    - for your slip joint nut (= compression joint in UK) 
        - 1.5" / 40mm
    - and a nut 
    - and maybe a length of pipe (also 1.5" / 40mm).
- What we did:
    - We bought a "cistern flush pipe coupling rubber conical washer seal" (see photo) from eBay, and used it to replace the previous one, which was rounded and had a uniform width (instead of tapered). This fixed the loose joint under our kitchen sink (early 2021).

    - We also bought one of these (see pic), which was a ["McAlpine T12A-3 1½" BSP Coupler White 40mm x 40mm"](https://www.screwfix.com/p/mcalpine-t12a-3-1-bsp-coupler-white-40mm-x-40mm/7195V) from Screwfix. The diagram shows how it would have worked if we'd needed it, but actually the replacement washer seems to have done the job.

## Installing a new kitchen mixer tap

### How to attach the pipes

When the pipes look like this...

- Extra advice based on experience (see also advice from friends below):
    - [This video is really good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C3ZjgMmS7E&t=380s)
    - Turn the water off at source first, in case of error
    - Make sure you clamp the bottom nut to hold everything still while you turn the top nut
    - The olives may not come off and you may need to cut the pipe - in which case you can use a small [tube cutter](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B085DNFZ36/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - only cost me £10 and worked like magic!
- Advice from friends:    
    - "Turn the screw 90 degrees and it'll isolate the valve, then you can detatch the top bit. They're called isolator valves if you need to Google."
    - "No welding required, those are compression joints and the bit in the middle is a valve. Turn the valve with a screwdriver to turn off water to the pipes coming off the tap, loosen the nut and the pipe should come out with that bronze bit (called an olive) round the outside near the end of the pipe. It's possible whoever fit it also put some tape/putty other stuff round the joint but you really don't need that with compression joints. If the olive won't come off the pipe or it's a bit bent then just buy some more, cost next to nothing. "
    - "the key lesson with them is to not over-tighten when you're doing it back up."
    - "it's an isolator valve with compression joints on the ends. Depending on how your new tap fits it might need that same copper pipe into it or it might have flexi pipes that just screw onto the top of the isolator valve, no olives or other bits needed. "
    - "Also a top tip - If you are installing a tap from Grohe, Germans use valves that are based on metric rather than imperial measurements and are ever so slightly differently sized from standard UK plumbing so you need an adaptor. Fine for going into compression joints, not fine for screwing onto things like isolator valves."

### How to get the right water pressure

Here's the question I posted on a [plumbing forum](https://www.diydoctor.org.uk/forums/plumbing-forum.html):

Hi 

I bought a simple kitchen mixer tap from Amazon, plumbed it in no problem. It works... but the water pressure is lower than it used to be. It now takes ages to fill the kettle. We are finding ourselves filling the kettle from the bathroom tap because we get impatient waiting for the kitchen tap! It used to have high water pressure with the previous tap, and all the other taps in the house have high water pressure.

I thought maybe the problem was due to the fact that the flexible metal hose attachment which joins onto our internal copper piping is a narrower diameter than the copper piping. So I bought another one, and the manufacturers assured me it contained standard fittings which should work with standard UK plumbing and give decent water pressure... but when it arrived it had the same fittings as the existing one - so I didn't bother trying to install it, I just sent it back.

The problem is, I don't know if I'm right that the problem is caused by the width of the pipe. Can you give me advice on how I tell whether I am buying the right product or not to get decent water pressure?

Here is the product I sent back because it seemed like the pipe was too narrow: https://www.victorianplumbing.co.uk/modern-mono-kitchen-tap-with-pull-out-rinser-chrome

Here is the product we currently have installed: https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0793N2D1T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Attached is a photo of the fittings below our sink - you can see the flexible pipes that come with the tap in the top half, and the original copper pipes in the bottom half.

Hoping someone can help!

Cheers
Clare.
