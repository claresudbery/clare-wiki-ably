- Notes: 
    - you need a rubber gasket (= washer in UK) 
    - for your slip joint nut (= compression joint in UK) 
        - 1.5" / 40mm
    - and a nut 
    - and maybe a length of pipe (also 1.5" / 40mm).
- What we did:
    - We bought a "cistern flush pipe coupling rubber conical washer seal" (see photo) from eBay, and used it to replace the previous one, which was rounded and had a uniform width (instead of tapered). This fixed the loose joint under our kitchen sink (early 2021).

    - We also bought one of these (see pic), which was a ["McAlpine T12A-3 1Â½" BSP Coupler White 40mm x 40mm"](https://www.screwfix.com/p/mcalpine-t12a-3-1-bsp-coupler-white-40mm-x-40mm/7195V) from Screwfix. The diagram shows how it would have worked if we'd needed it, but actually the replacement washer seems to have done the job.
