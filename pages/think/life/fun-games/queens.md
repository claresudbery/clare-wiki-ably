## Tips on how to play

- Look out for shapes which only occupy one square - give it a crown instantly
- Look for shapes which only inhabit one row/col - rule out everything else in that row/col
- Look for shapes which inhabit the whole of one row or col - rule out everything else in that shape
- Look for groups of shapes which between them only inhabit one set of rows / cols - rule out everything else in those rows/cols
- Look for these shapes, and rule out the indicated neighbouring squares:

- Keep doing all of the above repeatedly, looking for the same shapes and situations again after squares have been eliminated
  - eg a shape that occupies multiple rows/cols, after you eliminate many of its squares, might have remaining squares that...
    - ...only occupy one row or col
    - ...in combination with other shapes, only occupy a subset of rows or cols
    - ...represent one of the shapes in the image above
