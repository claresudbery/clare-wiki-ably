## What is this page all about?

There are certain questions that I often find myself asking, but someow never remember the answers. The problem I've always had whenever I rediscover those answers is... where can I make a note of this so that I'll know where to come the next time I forget? This page attempots to solve that problem.

## What's that birdsong that I hear every springtime - alternating notes in a minor third?

It's a great tit.
