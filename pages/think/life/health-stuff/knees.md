## Running and knees

- [Advice on protecting your knees while running](https://www.runandbecome.com/running-training-advice/running-technique-help-avoid-knee-injury)
  - NB: Cadence is the number of times your foot hits the ground per minute. According to [the above article](https://www.runandbecome.com/running-training-advice/running-technique-help-avoid-knee-injury), you should aim for the same cadence (around 180) whether you are running fast or slow - so you just increase your stride length to get a higher speed.
  - If you have a slow cadence it's easy to overstride and heel-strike (land on the heel of your foot instead of in the middle of your foot), which is bad for your knees.
