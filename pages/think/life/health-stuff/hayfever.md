## Top tips

Top tips for hayfever sufferers (courtesy of Jane / Digger):

- Put a sheet over your entire bed in the morning after getting up and carefully remove it before you get into bed. Pollen settles throughout the day (but especially in the evening) so it will settle on the sheet and not the bedclothes that you sleep in / on. 
- A bit of vaseline around the nose will catch a lot of pollen so it doesn't go up your nostrils
- Wearing glasses / sunglasses can reduce pollen getting into your eyes
- Try and keep bedroom windows and doors closed (if it's hot then keep curtains closed too to keep the room cool) during the day, open them at night.
