## Staying sane

- See [Staying sane during the COVID-19 crisis](/pages/think/life/health-stuff/Covid#staying-sane-during-the-covid-19-crisis) - there's a LOT of useful stuff in there.
- Random bits of pop-psychology advice that may or may not be useful:
    - "Beth" from GCHQ ([via Anne-Marie Imafidon's podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/beth-gchq-spying-security-and-sausage-rolls/id1454224152?i=1000431014174)) suggests that if you can, try to replace anger and anxiety with curiosity. What's happening here? Why?
    - Quote from Hank Green's novel [An Absolutely Remarkable Thing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24233708-an-absolutely-remarkable-thing): "When we care for each other, we are always in a place that matters."

## Eight secrets to a fairly fulfilled life

- Great article by Olvier Burkeman, ["Eight secrets to a fairly fulfilled life"](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/04/oliver-burkemans-last-column-the-eight-secrets-to-a-fairly-fulfilled-life)

## The ugh field

- The [ugh field](https://medium.com/@robertwiblin/ugh-fields-or-why-you-can-t-even-bear-to-think-about-that-task-5941837dac62) - how to get better at doing those tasks you keep putting off (not the ugh response as I previously thought).

## The ring theory

- The [ring theory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/promoting-hope-preventing-suicide/201705/ring-theory-helps-us-bring-comfort-in) of how to give support to people at the centre of a crisis and ask support from outer rings when you need support to help you support others.
