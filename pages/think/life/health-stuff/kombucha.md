## Kombucha instructions

- I followed these:
	- [First fermentation](https://www.youbrewkombucha.com/guide-to-first-fermentation)
	- [Second fermentation](https://www.youbrewkombucha.com/guide-to-2nd-fermentation)
	- [Flavouring](https://www.youbrewkombucha.com/flavoring)
## Step by step

- [[#1. Get drinking water free of chlorine]]
- [[#2. Sterilise the Kilner jar]]
- [[#3. Make tea]]
- [[#4. Cool sterilised jar]]
- [[#5. ADD TAP TO JAR]]
- [[#6. Put everything in jar]]
- Wait 1-2 weeks... then do [[#Second fermentation]]
### 1. Get drinking water free of chlorine

- Either use bottled water, or let it stand overnight, or boil it for half an hour
- If boiling...
	- Boil 4.5 litres drinking water (to fill 5 litre jar) for half an hour to get rid of chlorine
	- Boil kettles first (3 x 1.7 litres = 5.1, so need 2 full kettles + 1.1 litres in 3rd kettle (measured in measuring jug)), then pour each into pan on heat
	- Put lid on pan until it boils, then take lid off to allow chlorine to escape
	- Use Teflon pan
- ...otherwise just boil one kettle's worth of chlorine-free water to make the tea with

### 2. Sterilise the Kilner jar

- While drinking water's boiling, sterilise the Kilner jar:
- Take tap off before sterilising
- Can just sterilise in dishwasher!
- Or...
- 3 kettles of water into big non-Teflon pan
- First kettle has to be diluted with jug of cold water
- DON'T PUT KILNER JAR INTO BOILING WATER
- Warm jar first by immersing in hot tap water
- Check temp of initial water in pan using thermometer
- Put jar in after first kettle (diluted with cold water)
- Put jar in upside down with no tap attached
- Put tap and lid in separately
- Add 2 subsequent kettles while jar is already on stove
- Pour in carefully at side - don't let boiling water touch jar
- Water in pan will prob never totally boil, but the water inside the jar will bubble and steam
- Let it boil in pan for half an hour (ish)
### 3. Make tea

- When water in Teflon pan has had half an hour...
- Put 3 teabags in teapot
- ...and nearly a full cup of demerara sugar
- Important to start with teabags and sugar, otherwise pot will prob overflow!
- Use jug to nearly fill teapot with hot water from pan
- Stir well to dissolve sugar
- Leave for 15 mins
- Meanwhile, if you boiled water to get rid of chlorine, put pan containing rest of water into sink full of cold water, to bring temp down
- After 15 mins, check temp of both teapot and pan
	- You're aiming for 70-90 degrees FAHRENHEIT
	- If you didn't boil water to lose chlorine...
		- mix the tea with enough cold water to make 4.5 litres
		- Use a measuring jug
		- Mix it up in large Teflon pan
		- Check the temp of the mix - aiming for 70-90 degrees FAHRENHEIT
### 4. Cool sterilised jar

- Take sterilised jar out of pan and let it cool a bit
- Can put it in garden!
- Don't put straight into cold water!
### 5. ADD TAP TO JAR

- See diagram for correct arrangement of washers etc

### 6. Put everything in jar

- Remember to check temp of tea + cooled water is 70-90 degrees FAHRENHEIT
- Make sure tap is attached to jar!
- Add scoby + starter tea (ideally 2 cups of starter tea) to jar
- Remove teabags from teapot
- Add tea from teapot
- Fill with remaining boiled cooled water
- Don't seal with lid at this point - use cloth secured by string or rubber band
- Place on plate or something to catch crips in case tap leaks
- Place in room-temp-warm place for 1-2 weeks
- Try not to fiddle or disturb
- It's done when it's cloudy and tastes acidic - now you can either leave it to continue to ferment slowly, or you can do [[#Second fermentation]]
## Second fermentation

- Remove scoby and 2 cups starter tea
- Add flavour
	- I like apple + ginger
	- probably include fruit
	- good if it contains a little natural sugar
	- make sure you puree it - lumps don't work as well
	- See [tips here](https://www.youbrewkombucha.com/flavoring)
- Stir thoroughly
- Seal tightly
- Cover or put in dark place - avoid daylight
- Leave 2-3 days in room-temp-warm place
- After that, put in fridge (at this point, fermentation will prob stop)
