## Help for parents

Apparently a great book for parents of people with eating disorders is the book [Anorexia and other eating disorders, by Eva Musby](https://anorexiafamily.com/eva-musby-parent-help-anorexic-child-recover/?v=79cba1185463). It contains scripts of what parents should say (because it's very hard to get that right, and horribly easy to get it wrong. Simply commanding or begging or wheedling for your child to change their eating habits is unlikely to have the desired effect).   

Also apparently the organisation [Beat](https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/) are extremely useful.  

I heard about both of these because they were recommended by Caitlin Moran [on the "The Making Of" podcast](https://www.thefemaleleadsociety.com/the-making-of-caitlin-moran).
