- [Info about menopause, hormones and breast cancer](https://www.menopausedoctor.co.uk/news/a-guide-to-all-things-menopause-for-women-after-breast-cancer) (often HRT is problematic for breast cancer patients because of something to do with breast cancer and oestrogen receptors, which means that oestrogen can be bad? I might have got that wrong!)
