## Attaching bespoke labels and text and images to tins and mugs etc

You need:

- Waterslide decal transparent printing paper (our current printer - 2023 - is an inkjet so I got that kind) (fwiw the make of what I got was MDP / Mr Decal Paper)
- Clear Matte Finish Aerosol Spray for fixing (fwiw the make of what I got was Rust-Oleum)
- [Article here](http://bydreamsfactory.com/2013/05/all-about-waterslide-decal-paper.html/) on how to do it

## Loosening / untightening a stuck old screw

- I couldn't undo a screw in an old tap so I ended up following [this advice](https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/how-to-remove-a-stuck-screw/) 
- I needed: 
  - some penetrating oil (I bought WD40 specialist fast release penetrant)
  - some grinding compound / grinding paste (I bought Chemico grinding paste)
