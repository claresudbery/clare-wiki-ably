## To do / to-do list advice

1. Does it really need to be done?
2. What would happen if it wasn't done?
3. Can it be delegated?
4. Can it be done now?
5. Is it realistic?
6. Does it really need to be noted down? Will it remind you of itself naturally?Â 
7. Can it go in a lucky dip (a list of things you'd like to do - you'll draw items from it at random, on the understanding that the vast majority will never get done)?
