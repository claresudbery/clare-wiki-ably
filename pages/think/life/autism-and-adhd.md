- [UK DVLA - ADHD and driving advice](https://www.gov.uk/adhd-and-driving) 
    - you only have to let the DVLA (UK) know if your ADHD or related medication affects your ability to drive.
    - Insurance companies use the same guidelines as DVLA. "When you buy car insurance, you'll be asked if you have any DVLA-reportable medical conditions or disabilities." (from [here](https://www.gocompare.com/motoring/guides/medical-problems-and-driving/)). So, given that DVLA only want to hear about it if it affects your driving - you don't have to automatically inform them otherwise - then same applies to car insurance.
