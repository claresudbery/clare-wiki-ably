- [UK DVLA - ADHD and driving advice](https://www.gov.uk/adhd-and-driving) 
    - you only have to let the DVLA (UK) know if your ADHD or related medication affects your ability to drive.
    - Insurance companies use the same guidelines as DVLA. "When you buy car insurance, you'll be asked if you have any DVLA-reportable medical conditions or disabilities." (from [here](https://www.gocompare.com/motoring/guides/medical-problems-and-driving/)). So, given that DVLA only want to hear about it if it affects your driving - you don't have to automatically inform them otherwise - then same applies to car insurance.
- That sounds exhausting and difficult!
- I found a very interesting article recently about dealing with what is sometimes called "pathological demand avoidance" in autistic children. People who have suffered from it prefer to reframe it as "pervasive desire for autonomy", and there is a lot of interesting advice about how to understand what it feels like for the child and understand why standard parenting techniques often don't work. I can share it if you like.
