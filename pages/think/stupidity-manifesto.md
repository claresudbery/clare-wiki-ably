This came from my talk "Let's Stop Making Each Other Feel Stupid". You can see a video of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSn47NA0rVg&t=5s).

## LET’S STOP MAKING PEOPLE FEEL STUPID. INSTEAD, LET’S…

- Have an explicit policy of curiosity towards all things
- Encourage each other to shout out if we discourage curiosity
- Ask what people NEED to know, not what they know
- Never judge someone because their knowledge doesn’t match ours
- Give our colleagues every opportunity to learn and explore WITHOUT RISK
- Give new people a chance to show us what they can do
- ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO ASK QUESTIONS
- Acknowledge the broad range of knowledge in our industry
- Remember our industry never stays the same
- Remember we all forget stuff
- Lead by example: Be honest when we’re confused
- Focus on aptitude, not knowledge
- Remember what it feels like when we are still learning
- Prioritise clarity over jargon 
- Remember this is not idealism, it’s pragmatism
- LET’S STOP MAKING EACH OTHER FEEL STUPID.
