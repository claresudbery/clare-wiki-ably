## Moving a card

  - Change status, bottom right

## Closing or starting an iteration

  - (NB I found these orphaned notes with no context, so I canâ€™t swear
    they relate to Mingle, but I think they probably do)\]
  - First, add a new iteration:
      - Add Card, then select Iteration, top left
  - Closing / starting an iteration
  - kanban board
  - select iterations
  - filters on right
  - select Status - Is Not - Done
  - Top right - click List
  - Select all
  - click Edit properties
  - where it says "Iteration xx" - select a new iteration (you need to
    have created the new iteration)
  - Back in the filters,
  - select iteration is (previous iteration number)
  - select status - is - done
  - click edit properties again to check everything in correct
    iterations
  - Select iteration finished - select iteration number
