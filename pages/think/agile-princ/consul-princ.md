## Platforms are Products

Notes from Tito's Made Tech talk August 2020 (see also screenshots below):

- if one team has no interface with user, turn them into platform as product where other teams are their users
- give them physical boxes and pens and ask them to decorate them as though it was a product 
- give the users a choice - they don't have to use the platform 
- GovPaaS are a great example of a team creating platform as a product

## Think Big, Start Small

Notes from Tito's Made Tech talk August 2020: 

- people have a tendency to plan massive overhauls
- this can mean you have a giant budget
- but don't start with the giant goal
- eg overall goal is to decrese case load by 75%
- start by decreasing it by 5%, or 1%, or by just one case
    - set that as your first goal
- your plan is wrong, and you want to learn how it is wrong as early as possible
- small posoitive effects compound, they aren't linear
- don't underestimate the effect of experiencing victory
- maintain the big vision while experiencing the small victories towards that big goal.
