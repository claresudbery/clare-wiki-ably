## Platforms are Products

Notes from [Tito](https://twitter.com/rbs_tito)'s [Made Tech talk](https://www.madetech.com/resources/webinars/avoiding-the-legacy-trap-how-to-ensure-your-legacy-decisions-arent-holding-back-your-modernisation) August 2020 (see also screenshots below):

- if one team has no interface with user, turn them into platform as product where other teams are their users
- give them physical boxes and pens and ask them to decorate them as though it was a product 
- give the users a choice - they don't have to use the platform 
- GovPaaS are a great example of a team creating platform as a product

## Think Big, Start Small

Notes from [Tito](https://twitter.com/rbs_tito)'s [Made Tech talk](https://www.madetech.com/resources/webinars/avoiding-the-legacy-trap-how-to-ensure-your-legacy-decisions-arent-holding-back-your-modernisation) August 2020: 

- Think big by starting small. What's the tiniest thing I could do today to make a difference?
- people have a tendency to plan massive overhauls
- this can mean you have a giant budget
- but don't start with the giant goal
- eg overall goal is to decrese case load by 75%
- start by decreasing it by 5%, or 1%, or by just one case
    - set that as your first goal
- your plan is wrong, and you want to learn how it is wrong as early as possible
- small posoitive effects compound, they aren't linear
- don't underestimate the effect of experiencing victory
- maintain the big vision while experiencing the small victories towards that big goal.

## Effective teams

### Team Topologies - keep teams small

My notes from [Neil Vass (@Neil_Vass)](https://twitter.com/neil_vass)'s lightning talk at XP Manchester about the book [Team Topologies, by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais](https://teamtopologies.com/resources):

- Talking about the problem many companies have, of having large numbers of small independent teams who then aren't coordinated or joined up enough
- An idea: Instead of having a WIP limit, have a dependency limit 
- The more external dependencies your team has in progress at any one time, the more you will grind to a halt
- Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais
	- Neil has made [his own notes](https://www.notion.so/Useful-ideas-from-Team-Topologies-b3b83296015c4051978bdededb941957)
	- It's a book, and website, and GitHub repos, and training
	- The [website](https://teamtopologies.com/)
	- Various [useful resources](https://github.com/teamtopologies) referred to in the book
		- Also the [Accelerate book](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/) is useful
		- and the [Rapid Development book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93892.Rapid_Development)
	- The Stream Aligned Team can partner up with the Enabling Team 
	- Use Conway's Law
	- Platform as product:
		- There's a great 4-hour course by Manuel Pais about platform as product
		- Don't mandate the use of your platform - let people make choices - and that will focus you on maing your platform genuinely useful
	- Don't have more than 7-9 people on a team
		 - you don't have to have all the expertise within the team - some can be external to the team.

### Allow cross-pollenation between teams

- ["Stirring the pot" Twitter thread on this topic](https://twitter.com/ClareSudbery/status/1404359377566511106?s=20) arising from Kevlin Henney's interview on Making Tech Better

## Shift-Left 

"Shift left" means to move things from the right hand side of your kanban (or other) board to the left - ie bring them higher up in the process / do them earlier.
