## Things to Consider

- Pdf about user accessibility: https://app.luminpdf.com/viewer/5e9e2c75efb996001840a483
- Use free tools such as [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) or [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to test your website for accessibility. 
- Use your keyboard to tab between elements on the screen to check there is clear visible feedback for where you are on a web page.
- Accessibility is sometimes described as "A11y", in the same way that Observability is "O11y" - because they both have eleven letters between the first and last letter - and it's quicker to type that way.
