## Motivation

- Give team members options every week. 
    - What are you jealous of at the mo? Who's doing stuff you wish you were doing? What would you like to get involved in?
- Tailor jobs to people instead of the other way round. 
    - What are their strengths? What are their interests? what job can you create for them that will allow them to shine?
- Offer your to-do list to people junior to you
    - How would they like to progress? Which part of your job would like they have to have a go at doing? Give them a menu of options.

## Caring and Mentoring

- The biggest difference is made when you prove that you care - cf [Meri Williams on the Making Tech Better podcast](https://www.madetech.com/resources/podcasts/episode-10-meri-williams/), on taking food for the people who are up late fixing broken stuff.
