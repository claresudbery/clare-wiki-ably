# Agile leadership meetup, Made Tech 13/1/20

## Be a catalyst for change 
- by doing it yourself 
	- ask for justification then ask for the counter argument, to show that disagreement is OK
- Identify keystone behaviors, like transparency and visualisation, then demonstrate and facilitate them 
	- Postits and maps on clearly visible walls so people catch sight of them and come and ask questions 
- Encourage and praise 
- Find the courage zone by shifting your comfort zone 
- Identify small changes you can sustain and build on 

## facilitation guidelines 
- firm belief that client can solve their own problems
- Client is in charge at all times
