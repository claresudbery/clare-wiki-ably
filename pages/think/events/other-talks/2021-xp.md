## Prioritizing user stories remotely - a framework to help an agile team - Priscila Alcântara

1. Define and align the objectives
    - How and when do we see first version delivered
    - how and when do we see the users getting something that will delight them
2. Quadrants with axes for bueinss value and speed of delivery
3. How much can we deliver?
    - Use waves - wave 1, 2 and 3 (like phases?)
Now it becomes easy - include sponsor in team's process
