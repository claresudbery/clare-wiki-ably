## Asking for feedback after a talk

What thing did I do that was most helpful to you?
What thing could I have done to help you more?

## Keeping track of talks submitted and delivered

I have various things that I do:

- I have a public-facing web page which lists upcoming and previous talks - v simple to keep updated, means that I can just share it with people who want to know more, and also means I can keep track of what I've talked about, when and where. I frequently refer to it, it's really useful: https://medium.com/a-woman-in-technology/events-28336c2586df. The page also contains links to event websites and any videos released after the event, which is also useful.
- I have a folder in the cloud with sub-folders for all events, and for each event I keep things like: A copy of my submission for that event, a copy of my notes, a copy of any presentation I've created. It's particularly useful to keep a copy of submissions in a central place, as a lot of them are submitted via webforms which are not easy to return to - worth the minor overhead of copying text from a webform into a doc - particularly as I often reuse submissions for multiple events
- I have a Trello board with ideas for new talks
- I have a spreadsheet listing events I have submitted to and am considering submitting to, with info like whether they pay travel and expenses, when the submission deadline is, etc
- What I don't have is anything indexed by talk title - my folder structure effectively indexes by event - but that's fine because I tend to tweak each talk for each event so it means I have a snapshot of what the talk looked like when I delivered it for that event. Also I can just scan / search my web page listing talks.

## Quick tips for writing and delivering a talk / public speaking

- Tell a story - think about beginning, middle and end. Take the audience on a journey.
- Tell small stories to illustrate points.
- Make it personal if you can. Include your own experiences and how things make you feel.
- Don't write it out as a script unless you are supremely confident at your script reading / performing skills. 
    - You're much more likely to get good results if you write out simple bullet points, then use them as prompts and allow the actual words to come out naturally on the day. 
        - This will make it sound much more relaxed and less stilted.
    - Bullet points are a really simple way to create talk notes that allow you to see the outline of the talk at a glance and check its shape while you're writing it.
    - Keep the bullet points really short and simple.
- Make eye contact with the audience (if you can).
    - If you can't (likely because remote), encourage them to use chat / Q&AS functions to interact with you and give you feedback, then make sure you've arranged your screen so you can see them.
- Talk about what you know
- Talk about what you're enthusiastic about
- Don't worry about whether anyone else has spoken on this topic before or whether others know more than you. You're there to tell YOUR story, and there's plenty audience to go round.
- If you can remember what it felt like when you didn't know what you know now, that will help you to imagine what your audience feels like.
    - It will also help to remind you that nobody knows everything and there will always be audiences out there who don't yet know what you know.
