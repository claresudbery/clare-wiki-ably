## Asking for feedback after a talk

What thing did I do that was most helpful to you?
What thing could I have done to help you more?

## Keeping track of talks submitted and delivered

I have various things that I do:

- I have a public-facing web page which lists upcoming and previous talks - v simple to keep updated, means that I can just share it with people who want to know more, and also means I can keep track of what I've talked about, when and where. I frequently refer to it, it's really useful: https://medium.com/a-woman-in-technology/events-28336c2586df. The page also contains links to event websites and any videos released after the event, which is also useful.
- I have a folder in the cloud with sub-folders for all events, and for each event I keep things like: A copy of my submission for that event, a copy of my notes, a copy of any presentation I've created. It's particularly useful to keep a copy of submissions in a central place, as a lot of them are submitted via webforms which are not easy to return to - worth the minor overhead of copying text from a webform into a doc - particularly as I often reuse submissions for multiple events
- I have a Trello board with ideas for new talks
- I have a spreadsheet listing events I have submitted to and am considering submitting to, with info like whether they pay travel and expenses, when the submission deadline is, etc
- What I don't have is anything indexed by talk title - my folder structure effectively indexes by event - but that's fine because I tend to tweak each talk for each event so it means I have a snapshot of what the talk looked like when I delivered it for that event. Also I can just scan / search my web page listing talks.
