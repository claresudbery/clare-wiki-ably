## Spirit Animals 

- Everybody draw an animal or if in Miro, choose an avatar for your animal using Icon Picker (three dots at the bottom of the tool bar on the right). Write / add a post-it next to it something like "Hello, I'm Clare and my spirit animal is a hedgehog". Take it in turns to explain why you picked your animal, then pick the next person to also explain their animal
    - Potential gotcha: It's hard to work out whether everybpdy has gone yet.

## Balloons and Names

This could be a warmup exercise... (via Amanda Nicholls on LinkedIn)

"A wise teacher once brought balloons to school, told her pupils to blow them up and write their name on one. After the children tossed their balloons into the hall, the teacher moved through the hall mixing them all up.

The kids were given five minutes to find the balloon with their name on it, but though they searched frantically, no one found their own balloon.

Then the teacher told them to take the balloon closest to them and give it to the person whose name was on it. In less than two minutes, everyone was holding their own balloon.

The teacher said to the children, “These balloons are like happiness. We won't find it when we're only searching for our own. But if we care about someone else's happiness...it will ultimately help us find our own.”"
