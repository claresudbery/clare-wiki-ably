## Spirit Animals 

- Everybody draw an animal or if in Miro, choose an avatar for your animal using Icon Picker (three dots at the bottom of the tool bar on the right). Write / add a post-it next to it something like "Hello, I'm Clare and my spirit animal is a hedgehog". Take it in turns to explain why you picked your animal, then pick the next person to also explain their animal
    - Potential gotcha: It's hard to work out whether everybpdy has gone yet.
