# Collaborative Drawing / Dependencies Between Groups

Dave Rooney: I’m facilitating a workshop this week for our company’s product owners this week. I ran an exercise yesterday to demonstrate handling dependencies between groups, in which 4 pairs of people had to draw different aspects of an image of Spiderman. One did the outline, one did the eyes, one did the shading and the 4th drew the “web” artwork.
In the first round, they were given their instructions and told to go off and do their work. They had 5 minutes. For the second round they could plan together for 2 minutes and then draw separately for 3 mins. For the final round they had 5 minutes to work however they wanted. Here are the results, with Round 1 on the left and Round 3 on the right.

The first round went exactly as expected, and visualized how most teams in the company go about dealing with dependencies. The second was actually pretty good, with initial collaboration but separate work. The third wasn’t quite “perfect” but all of the separate parts fit together quite well.
I’m really happy with how the exercise turned out!

What a great exercise! I can see a follow on (or parallel) one where they're asked to draw something, but only one person knows what it looks like—and they're not on any of the teams.

I'm curious: are they drawing on separate surfaces/canvases, and then combining them somehow?

Looks like transparencies

Yes, it was on 4 different transparencies which are then overlaid on each other

Nice illustration of individual work and integration problems.

I’ll give Esther Derby & Don Gray a chunk of the credit because I did use my PSL experience to come up with the idea and how to think through creating the problem for them to solve.
