## Approaches

### Tito's Trello approach for remote sharing

- Two columns in a shared Trello board, which everyone accesses individually on laptops: "Top successes" and "Something I wish I was getting"
- Everyone is allowed to add 2 cards (no more) to each column - this number can be tweaked according to number of participants
- People should add their faces to their own cards
    - (top tip! hover over a card and press spacebar to add your face)
- Everyone has as many votes as they like
    - Vote by adding your face to the card
    - For successes, vote for what you'd like to hear more about
    - For wish lists, vote for what you have something to contribute on
- Order the cards in the order of those with the most votes
- Discuss cards
    - Alternate between successes and wish list items
    - Start at the top (ie those with most votes)
    - Keep going until you are out of time
    - You can set a gtime limit for each card if you like.
