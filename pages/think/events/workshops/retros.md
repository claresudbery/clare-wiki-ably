## Approaches

### Tito's Trello approach for remote collaboration

- In a shared Trello board, which everyone accesses individually on laptops, two columns: 
    - "Top successes" 
    - "Something I wish I was getting"
- Everyone is allowed to add 2 cards (no more) to each column - this number can be tweaked according to number of participants
- People should add their faces to their own cards
    - (top tip! hover over a card and press spacebar to add your face)
- Everyone has as many votes as they like
    - Vote by adding your face to the card
    - For successes, vote for what you'd like to hear more about
    - For wish lists, vote for what you have something to contribute on
- Order the cards in the order of those with the most votes
- Discuss cards
    - Alternate between successes and wish list items
    - Start at the top (ie those with most votes)
    - Keep going until you are out of time
    - You can set a time limit for each card if you like

## Storyboard Retro

- Outcome of a "storyboard" retro format (PRIVATE): `2018-02-09_Retro-storyboard.JPG` here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Jbbb7dMx1OWGrB3cWOeTcCSKlUHV4Vnj
- The way this worked was that people in groups drew pictures representing what their desired future would look like at the end of the next sprint, and then played them back to the wider group.
