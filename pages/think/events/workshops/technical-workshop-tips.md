## General Lessons

  - Establish a culture of learning:
      - The team benefits when every member feels they can learn and
        explore technologies
      - There’s a big cultural benefit to encouraging everybody to ask
        any question at all – no question is ever “stupid”, and people
        in senior technical roles can lead by example
      - People – at all levels of seniority - should feel safe to be
        honest about areas where they are inexperienced
      - In similar vein, nobody should ever be criticised or mocked for
        not knowing something. If somebody has a knowledge gap then it
        is the responsibility of the whole team to assist them in
        closing that gap
      - An open willingness to learn is much more valuable than an
        ability to regurgitate memorised facts
  - Have regular one to ones with team members to get a feel for who
    needs help with what, and identify where group sessions would be
    helpful.

## Preparing for Workshops

  - When people are delivering workshops, they need to be given time to
    prepare
  - You can arrange group learning sessions which do not have to rely on
    one “expert” knowing the targeted topic.
      - Instead, the group can find an online resource – such as a
        tutorial or Pluralsight course – and work through it together.
      - In this scenario, the group should feel free to go at whatever
        pace works for them
      - They should also feel free to go off at tangents and explore
        related topics
  - Don’t feel that resources have to be created from scratch – this can
    be time consuming, and chances are somebody else will have already
    done it for you. Google is your friend\!
  - Consider who is being invited to each session
      - Has anyone been left out? Are there members of other teams that
        might benefit?
      - Do not assume that anyone should be excluded – the team as a
        whole will benefit from individual members learning new skills
      - Not everybody needs to have a session in their calendar – you
        can send broadcasts out which detail upcoming sessions for
        potentially interested parties

## Workshop Resources

  - Keep hold of resources from previous workshops so that you can do
    them again.
  - It’s a very good idea to create skeleton projects with useful
    starting points in code, and place these in a central GitHub
    repository where everybody can reach them.

## Booking Rooms for Workshops

  - If using Outlook: When adding a meeting in Outlook, click Scheduling
    Assistant at the top
      - Then click Add Rooms, bottom left
      - This allows you to select multiple possible rooms and then
        examine their calendars side by side to find a suitable
        date/time and room
      - Training rooms may be in a separate address book – select
        “Global address list” from the Address book dropdown, top
        right
  - You need to choose a room that has a decent screen.

## Running Workshops

  - Sessions work best if they are hands on. Give people plenty of time
    to explore the concepts being introduced – ideally in pairs.
      - This has the added benefit that less preparation is required:
        rather than creating a lengthy series of slides, focus on having
        something to do.

  - Setting the scene: Establish the aims of any workshop at the start,
    and remind people to be kind to one another and any other guidelines
    you wish to establish.
  - Similarly, at the end of a session, do a wrap-up to summarise what
    has been achieved
      - Also try to do some form of retrospective – this can be really
        quick and simple, e.g. two sections for Successes and Areas for
        Improvement, and people write quick post-its for each section.
  - Ways of working: Pairs work very well, and sometimes you can have a
    “mob” – where the whole group works on one problem together.
      - If working with pairs, aim to swap partners regularly.
      - If working with a mob, you can have names in a hat and regularly
        (eg every ten minutes) swap the person who is at the keyboard.
      - You can also have two people at the keyboard – a “driver”
        (keyboard operator) and a “navigator” (person who decides what
        will be done next).
          - These can be decided by names from a hat at ten-minute
            intervals.
          - Names do not go back into the hat until all names have been
            used.
          - The navigator can go on to become the driver each time, so
            only one new person jumps in every ten minutes.
          - When using this technique, it is a good idea to deliberately
            start with an experienced pair, who can get people started.
  - When putting people into pairs, try to pair experienced with
    inexperienced where possible.
      - Although sometimes it can be helpful to have two inexperienced
        people together, as they can help each other learn.
  - Have regular health checks – check how people are doing and get
    pairs to share what they’ve been working on
  - Pay attention to engagement levels. Look out for:
      - The whole room looking bored – move onto something more meaty
      - The whole room looking confused – slow things down and give room
        to explore things in smaller chunks
      - An individual looking unengaged / on their phone, etc – get them
        involved by directing questions at them
      - An individual looking confused – give them some individual
        attention – ask them questions to establish where they got
        stuck.
