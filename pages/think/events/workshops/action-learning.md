## Notes from Ludovine's Made Tech showcase

From Ludivine's Made Tech showcase talk about her experiences with Action Learning (see book "You're Not Listening").

- Get together in groups of 4-8
- Use listening and asking questions to help people solve their own problems
- Start by bidding on what you will discuss
- People propose a problem they're each trying to solve
- Structure:
    - Intro
    - Open questioning
    - (Optional) asking the group for advice if the individual chooses to do so
    - Reflection and actions
- Anyone can present a challenge they're facing
    - It's optional, you don't have to!
    - Must be
        - important 
        - time relevant 
        - within your authrotiy 
    - Must not be 
        - something with a trivial solution 
        - be owned by someone else
- All questions must be open (what, where, who, why, what if)
    - be careful with why or what if because they can hide a judgement
    - observe each other and highlight it if questions are closed rather than open
- Confidentiality and trust are important
- No judgement 
- No uninvited advice
    - Allow presenters to find their own solutions
- Try to commit to taking actions
    - Check back in during the next session to see whether people have attempted to act and track progress
- Benefits:
    - Solve problems via shift of perspective
    - Develop powerful questioning, empathy and listening skills
    - Create strong relationships and build trust
    - Learn from each other
    - Build your resilience and resourcefulness
