## Ways / Techniques for operating practical exercises

- Distributed learning: Split people into groups and get each group to research answers to questions within a particular subject area. Then each group comes back and presents what they've learnt to the wider session. Each group learns more on their individual topic, all groups learn via the presentations at the end. 

## General Workshop Tips

- Try to have a retro at the end, you can use FunRetro and have columns Keep Doing, Stop Doing, Should be Doing. Give people a chance to dot vote and actually discuss the cards they have added.
