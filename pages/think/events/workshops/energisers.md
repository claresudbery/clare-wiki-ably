## rock paper scissors championship 

- Works best with large groups
- Everybody in the room finds a pair and plays three rounds of Rock Paper Scissors
    - Give rules! Otherwise some people do one, two, play and some do one, two, three, play
- The winner finds another winner to compete against. The loser becomes their cheerleader and has to follow them round chanting their name
- The number of players becomes smaller and each player gets a larger and larger group of cheerleaders until there are only two players left, and one of them wins!
- We played this at the thoughtworks Away Day in Birmingham, and at the Agile Leadership meetup at Made Tech in London 13/1/20 - I won!
