## Simple icebreakers

- stand back to back, one describes a picture, the other draws it. 
- Draw a picture of your worst fear. 
- Write down something nobody knows about you, then we have to guess which one is who.
- "1,2 ... 3,1" (see below)

## rock paper scissors championship 

- Works best with large groups
- Everybody in the room finds a pair and plays three rounds of Rock Paper Scissors
    - Give rules! Otherwise some people do one, two, play and some do one, two, three, play
- The winner finds another winner to compete against. The loser becomes their cheerleader and has to follow them round chanting their name
- The number of players becomes smaller and each player gets a larger and larger group of cheerleaders until there are only two players left, and one of them wins!
- We played this at the thoughtworks Away Day in Birmingham, and at the Agile Leadership meetup at Made Tech in London 13/1/20 - I won!

## "1,2 ... 3,1"

- Everybody stand up.
- When the leader says "One," everyone else must say "Two."
- When the leader says "Two," everyone else must say "Three."  
- When the leader says "Three," everyone else must say "One."  
- Start by practising that, then when they've got the hang of it, tell them that every time THEY say "One," they must clap (it's harder than it sounds).
- That's it!
