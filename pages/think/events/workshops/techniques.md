- [Running a remote inception / remote workshops](/pages/think/events/workshops/Remote-Inception)

## Types of workshop

- Five whys
- Futurespective
- Value stream mapping
- Empathy mapping
- Stakeholder empathy mapping
- Event storming
- Service mapping
- User journey / story mapping
- Elevator pitch
- Trade-off sliders 
- CRC cards
	- blank CRC cards 
- Value proposition map / value proposition design
	- [Real example here](https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-tech/blob/master/resources/images/value-proposition-map.png) (Clare only) 
	- [Blank example here](value-proposition-map-blank.jpeg)
	- Over on the far right you list the things you want to achieve ("jobs to be done")
	- In the same section, you list gains that users might get
	- Under that list things that are currently painful for users
	- On the far left, list features / services in your solution
	- Also list ways in which gains might be achieved ("gain creators) 
	- Also list ways in which pains might be alleviated ("pain relievers")	
	- Now you want to cross-reference 
		- (? I'm not 100% sure I'#ve got this bit right - need to check)
		- for each job, check that it has an associated service / feature
		- for each gain, check that it has an associated gain creator
		- for each pain, check that it has an associated pain reliever
		- for each feature / service, check that it has an associated gain creator or pain reliever
- Data mapping
	- [Real example here](https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-tech/blob/master/resources/images/data-mapping.png)(clare only)
	- get people to start by adding postits for sources and destinations of data
	- then add lines to indicate how data moves from one place to another
- As-is and to-be user journey mapping
	- Real examples [here](https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-tech/blob/master/resources/images/as-is-user-journey-map.png) and [here](https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-tech/blob/master/resources/images/to-be-user-journey-map.png) (clare only)
	- As-is:
	- put the ultimate goal over on the right
	- add post-its to represent steps along the way
	- have a line underneath that represents whether each step makes happier or sadder
	- Pink post-its underneath document pain points
	- Blue post-its above document possible quick wins that will improve things for the user
	- To-be:
	- Now do the same again but for the suggested improvement journey (or to represent a brand new journey)
- Storyboarding
	- [Real example in this repo](/resources/images/storyboarding.png)
	- Fold paper to create 8 panels, then use them to create a ocmic strip that describes a blue-sky imagined new or improved user journey.
