## Tips for running technical workshops

- See [here](/pages/think/events/workshops/Technical-Workshop-Tips).

## Technical workshops (some I have run myself, some are self-led)

Sorry, at the time of writing some of these resources will not be publicly available. A lot of them are though!

Some of these workshops can be self led - ie just give the relevant link to individuals or pairs and let them work independently. But some of them are designed to be facilitated as a group exercise.
