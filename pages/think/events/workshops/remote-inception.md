## Overview

In March 2020, due to a desire to restrict meetings and travel to slow the spread of [COVID-19](/pages/think/life/Health/https://clare-wiki.herokuapp.com/pages/think/life/Health#covid-19-coronavirus-sars-cov-2) (commonly referred to as coronavirus), we at [Made Tech](https://www.madetech.com/) and [Difrent](https://difrent.co.uk) are running a two-week inception entirely remotely, with our client [Skills for Care](https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/).

Here I'm recording some notes about what we are doing.

## Dos

Here is what we sent out to participants the week before the inception started:

- Please dial in individually. That is to say, don't be in the same room as any other participant. This will significantly improve the experience for everyone who is working from home.
- Please, if at all possible, use a headset with dedicated microphone. This too will improve the experience for all participants. If you can't get one in time for Monday, it's still worth getting one in time for subsequent days.
- If you haven't used Zoom before then before 10am Monday, please click on the Zoom link in the invite. This will cause Zoom to download on your machine and hopefully give you a chance to troubleshoot any problems (not that we expect any).
- Please dial in prompt at 10am Monday (or even a few minutes before).

More things to do:

- Create deliberate opportunities for water-cooler moments, ie have group sessions purely designed for chat.
	- You can also do this on an individual basis with "coffee and cake" sessions - which can be randomly generated pairings.
- Start with an intro where you set expectations 
	- we are assuming everyone has best intentions
- Do a short exercise at the start of the first day where everyone practises using the tools you are expecting them to use.
- If you have a large number of participants, use smaller breakout rooms for most activities (Zoom allows you to do this - I don't know about other tools). This will increase engagement and lessen the chance of people zoning out.

## Don'ts

- Don't assume you'll have connectivity. Remote working tools are struggling with [outages due to the surge in usage](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/12/remote_work_struggles/)

## Tools we are using

- Miro
	- Collaborate on diagrams
	- Have separate "radiators" eg a parking lot area to make notes on things you don't have time to dicuss now
	- Remote post-it exercises
- Zoom 
	- Host meetings
	- Create smaller breakout rooms for smaller discussions
	- Share screens
	- See all participants
	- Mute mics
	- Share video of yourself (or not)
	- Use a thumbs-up icon to indicate understanding / agreement (instead of having to unmute/mute again)
- Google hangouts (backup in case there are any Zoom outages because of increased load due to COVID-19)
