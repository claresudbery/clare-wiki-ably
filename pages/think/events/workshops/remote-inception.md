## Overview

In March 2020, due to a desire to restrict meetings and travel to slow the spread of [COVID-19](/pages/think/life/Health/https://clare-wiki.herokuapp.com/pages/think/life/Health#covid-19-coronavirus-sars-cov-2) (commonly referred to as coronavirus), we at [Made Tech](https://www.madetech.com/) ran a two-week inception entirely remotely, with our client [Skills for Care](https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/).

Here I'm recording some notes about what we did.

## Dos

Here is what we sent out to participants the week before the inception started:

- Please dial in individually. That is to say, don't be in the same room as any other participant. This will significantly improve the experience for everyone who is working from home.
- Please, if at all possible, use a headset with dedicated microphone. This too will improve the experience for all participants. If you can't get one in time for Monday, it's still worth getting one in time for subsequent days.
- If you haven't used Zoom before then before 10am Monday, please click on the Zoom link in the invite. This will cause Zoom to download on your machine and hopefully give you a chance to troubleshoot any problems (not that we expect any).
- Please dial in prompt at 10am Monday (or even a few minutes before).
