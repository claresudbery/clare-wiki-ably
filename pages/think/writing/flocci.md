## Sentient cupboard

  - Its door is hyper cool

  - Its legs look just like tusks

  - It’s true if it’s a bool

  - It dances AND it busks

## Discombobulated

  - Bob’s idle atom cud

## Stories

### Rave on a Roundabout

  - I’m 19

  - I want to go to one of the infamous Blackburn raves

  - I persuade my friend Mike to drive his tiny Mini

  - We meet at the rendezvous point - hundreds of cars parked outside a
    pub on a country lane

  - Suddenly the signal - we’re off\!

  - Car follows car follows car in a giant convoy.

  - But it’s going too fast

  - Mike’s tiny old Mini can’t keep up

  - We lose the car in front

  - Hundreds of cars are following us

  - But we don’t know where we’re going.

  - We reach a giant roundabout over a motorway

  - It’s three lanes wide, so we just join the roundabout and drive
    slowly round in circles

  - We’re waiting for somebody to arrive who knows where they’re going

  - They can lead us off like the pied piper

  - But nobody knows where they’re going\!

  - Slowly the roundabout completely fills up with cars, all slowly
    driving in a giant circle

  - Windows are open, people are hanging out of windows, even sitting on
    car roofs

  - Music is blasting out, doobies are lit up

  - It’s a rave on a roundabout\!

  - Finally somebody comes back from the rave, finds us, leads us to the
    field, or warehouse, or warehouse in a field, where the rave is
    happening

  - But the police have got there first

  - They turn us away

  - We go home

  - The end.

  - (I never did get to one of those Blackburn raves)

## Room smells of cloves

Me in 9-yr-old's room: "It smells of cloves in here."  

Son: "Yes."  

Me: "But why does it smell of cloves?"  

Son: "Because there are cloves in here."  

Me: "Why are there cloves in here?"  

Son: "They're everywhere. I'm wearing them."  

Me: "Huh? Why are you wearing cloves?"  

Me again: "Oh, hang on..."
