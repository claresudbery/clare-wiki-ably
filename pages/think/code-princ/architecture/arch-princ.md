## Things to think about for webapps

- CMS (Content Management System)
    - No hard-coded strings
    - Content changes can be made without deploying
- SPA
    - Single Page Architecture
- Progressive enhancement
    - No javascript by default
    - Not possible with client-side rendering
- Client-Side Rendering (CSR) vs Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
