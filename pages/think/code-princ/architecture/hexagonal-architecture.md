## GitHub Repos

Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

- [ClaresPancakes](https://github.com/claresudbery/ClaresPancakes)
    - This was the companion code base to the blog poist I wrote on hexagonal architecture for the LateRooms Engineering blog.

## Docs and Blog Posts

- (TO DO) My blog post on Hexagonal Architecture was originally posted on the LateRooms blog and no longer exists. But I have the original doc and am in the process of making it available again [here](/pages/think/code-princ/architecture/Hexagonal-Architecture-Blog-Post).
- Hexagonal architecture is also referred to as "clean" architecture. [More here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eNRRkTVf3OSDtGHGQZpnzUwJTxKeg-Zb/view) (I also have this downloaded in OneDrive/IT Training/Current) and [here](https://github.com/madetech/clean-architecture).
