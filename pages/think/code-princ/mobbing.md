## The Driver-Navigator Technique for Large Mobs
(Note for Clare - this is linked to from elsewhere so don't change this title!) 

- Once you get beyond five or six people, mobs can become ineffective:
    - Only the really confident people will take part
    - Everyone else will observe silently
    - Most people will probably disengage and lose track of what’s going on
- One solution is to split into smaller mobs in separate rooms
- Another is to split into sub-groups that stay in the same room
    - You rotate between the sub-groups
    - Rotate frequently (eg every 10 mins)
    - This way there are a smaller number of voices at any one time
    - Allow full-group discussion for 1-2 mins between each mini-mob
    - Everyone in each sub-group is more motivated to participate when it’s their turn
    - Be explicit about the rules of the mob (No 1: BE KIND TO EACH OTHER - see [Woody Zuill](https://woodyzuill.com/) for more guidance if you haven't mobbed before)
    - One member of each sub-group stays on to be the driver for the next group
    - When it’s not your turn, you still pay attention because you know it will be your turn soon
    - Use [this handy mob timer](https://cuckoo.team/)
    - Nominate someone in each mini-mob to be chat monitor. The observers are allowed to post suggestions in the chat. The chat monitor brings suggestions to the attention of the mini-mob and the mini-mob can decide whether to pay attention or ignore.
- An example:
    - We have thirteen people in our mob, split into three groups:
        - Group 1:
            - Anne
            - Bob
            - Clare
            - Dana
            - Ed
        - Group 2:
            - Fred
            - Gill
            - Harry
            - Indigo
        - Group 3:
            - Joan
            - Kate
            - Louis
            - Max
    - For the first ten mins, 
        - Driver = Max (the last person on the “previous” group)
        - Navigators = Group 1 = Anne, Bob, Clare, Dana, Ed
    - For the next ten mins,
        - Driver = Ed (last person from previous group)
        - Navigators = Group 2 = Fred, Gill, Harry, Indigo
    - (etc)
    - When all groups have had a turn, choose a different person from the previous group to be the driver (eg, Dana instead of Ed)
