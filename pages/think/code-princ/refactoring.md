Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

    - From workshop done with Mark Kirschstein at LateRooms.
- [RefactoringExamples (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/RefactoringExamples)
