## GitHub Repos

Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

- [CodeRetreatLegacy2](https://github.com/claresudbery/CodeRetreatLegacy2)
    - From workshop done with Mark Kirschstein at LateRooms.
- [RefactoringExamples (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/RefactoringExamples)
    - The original markdown for my series of refactoring articles that are being published on Martin Fowler's site.
