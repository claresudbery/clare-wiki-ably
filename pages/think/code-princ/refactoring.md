## GitHub Repos

Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

- [CodeRetreatLegacy2](https://github.com/claresudbery/CodeRetreatLegacy2)
    - From workshop done with Mark Kirschstein at LateRooms.
- [RefactoringExamples (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/RefactoringExamples)
    - The original markdown for my [refactoring article on Martin Fowler's site](https://martinfowler.com/articles/class-too-large.html).

## Code you can use for refactoring exercises

## Actual sample code

- Mark Kirschtein's [ferry booking example](github.com/Kirschstein/legacy-ferry-booking-system)
- Gilded Rose - described by Mark Kirschtein as "the canonical example" and [documented at some length by Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) - as well as translated into several different languages.
- [JBrains' Trivia](https://github.com/jbrains/trivia) - Mark Kirschtein uses this at legacy coding retreats. It's also been translated into many different languages.
- Mark Kirschtein says: "Another approach is to take a well known problem, checkout, potterkata etc and do it badly, that way you don't need to explain the domain."
- Emily Bache has several refactoring katas, recommended by many people:
    - [Tennis Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata) - Jeremy Cook (@JCook21) says if Parrot example too simplistic then Tennis kata might work well.
    - [Parrot Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Parrot-Refactoring-Kata) - described by Jeremy Cook (@JCook21) as "The very simplest example that I know"
    - [Theatrical Players Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Theatrical-Players-Refactoring-Kata)
    - [Supermarket Receipt Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/SupermarketReceipt-Refactoring-Kata)
    - Gilded Rose - see above
- Jim Jeffries (@JJeffires1): "I sometimes use the [trip service kata from @sandromancuso](https://github.com/sandromancuso/trip-service-kata)
 for this. It's partly about getting tests round some code, but if you do that bit beforehand you can get straight into refactoring."
 - @LisaCrispin says "@janetgregoryca has a great non-code exercise for that."
