## Misc

  - Interesting conversation about the benefits of the functional
    approach

## Functional programming - smells

  - Strength of functional = heterogeneity and lack of
    strongly-typedness
  - But this means you don’t have the confidence of the compiler via
    compiler errors
  - Some Clojure concepts like protocols and record types provide levels
    of typing and interop with java interfaces and are about
    polymorphism.
  - You could pass the wrong things to the wrong thing. Nothing
    fundamental in the code prevents you from fucking up. Could maybe
    use spec to accomplish this?
