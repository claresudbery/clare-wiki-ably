## Book: The Nature of Software Development, by Ron Jeffries

- [The Nature of Software Development by Ron Jeffries](https://pragprog.com/titles/rjnsd/the-nature-of-software-development/) - "this is one of my favourite books at the moment and it's helped so much with these conversations" [about things like not being in a rush when developing software] (comment made by my colleague in a Slack thread)

## Deliver value quickly, then get feedback

•	Value is what you want
•	Each feature adds value
•	Iterate: Get FEEDBACK (Information has value)
•	Deliver high value features first (imgs p 14, 15, 16 – tall rectangles first)
•	Deliver minimal functionality first (img p11 – rocking horse then car)
•	Deliver foundation along with functionality, but absolute minimum (imgs of walls + tops, p54, 55, 57, 58)
•	Incremental vs waterfall: value released earlier: p24 graph
