## Tools

- [Cyber-dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/) is a fantastic tool for getting straight into a kata in any language without setting up an IDE or dev environment. Really useful for workshopping in groups. Note that if you are not using it in a not-for-profit context, you should buy a (very cheap) licence. Details [here](https://blog.cyber-dojo.org/2015/08/cyber-dojo-foundation.html).
