- Great article by Emily Bache [here](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/03/principles-for-agile-test-automation-2nd-edition/) about the four principles of agile test automation - which are readability, robustness, speed and updatability. If you have all four of those, then you have maintainability.
