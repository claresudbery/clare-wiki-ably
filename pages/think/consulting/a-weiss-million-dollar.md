## Notes on Alan Weiss' book, Million Dollar Consulting

### Note for Clare

I have the following:

- Access to online course (see 1password - search for "Weiss" or "million")
- Hard copy of Million Dollar Consulting Proposals (1st edition?)
- Kindle version of Million dollar Consulting, 5th edition
- Kindle version of Million dollar Consulting, 6th edition

### How to interrupt politely

Use rhetorical permission:

- "May I stop you right there - you said something vitally important"
- "Excuse me but I think you've said in 3 different ways that X. Is that right?"
- "Pardon me but can we discuss that last point further before moving on?"
- "May I summarise what you've been saying, to make sure I'm on the right track?"

### Sealing the deal

- Start with conceptual agreement
  - ...but conceptual agreement no use unless you're talking to actual economic buyer
- you want to agree three things:
  - 1. 4-6 objectives:
    - business outcomes, not deliverables
    - convert inputs/outputs/tasks into outcomes by asking why. "We want a training course" => "why?"
  - 2. metrics / measures of success:
    - at least one metric for each objective
  - 3. value statements
    - at least three value statements for each objective 
      - why/how does this outcome being value for the business?
    - at least half of the value statements be monetised
      - go for conservative estimates 
      - take the lowest end of ranges provided by them, or cut numbers in half 
        - so you can say your dramatic ROI is based on conservative estimates provided by the buyer. If they won't give you numbers, they don't trust you and you're rushing the process. If they can't give you numbers, help them to estimate right figures by walking them through it

### Fees

- "My fee represents my contribution to this project, with dramatic return on investment for you, and equitable compensation for me."
- Fees are not agreed at same time as conceptual agreement: "it would be unfair to you for me to quote a fee without properly considering what we've discussed. I can get back to you within 24 hours."

### Retainers

- They pay for access. They contact you, you don't contact them.
- Specify by name which individuals have access
- minimum 90 day duration, paid quarterly upfront at start of quarter
- specify contact type, eg in person or by email or by zoom - in person costs more
- never agree to conduct projects as part of a retainer
- if you have a strong brand, charge at least $7500 per month

### Options

- Never give them all or nothing to choose from
- Instead of "would you like to go out to dinner?" It's "where would you like to go out to dinner?" And even better, be specific: "would you like to eat at A, B or C?"
- Every option should meet the objectives
- Successive options should meet the objectives, provide even more value, and cost more accordingly.
