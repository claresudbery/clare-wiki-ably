### Skills Matrices

- Skills Matrix is a thing you can use to track engineers' existing skills. [This is an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_eSoLiWOLeLOxOERF22UiWsjsp59thy1fd8JPhRif4/edit?usp=sharing) of a matrix that you can ask your engineers to fill in, then you can review it with them on a regular basis to track progress. 
    - There is a [presentation here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18gqpL9ky00CQZ11gh4GWll5Pg6xxHi_g/view?usp=sharing) which is used to introduce the skills matrix and how to use it.
    - Note that the skills matrix references a powerpoint presentation, "Practices - Categories.pptx", which lists all the skills and explains what the scores represent, and is [available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1569G1kM5YhBfFR9qB7pLNcBo_o1niGAn/view?usp=sharing). 
    - [Here is another version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BzyJWBHgXe6G46DbLNQ96wDxIXeYKIwh/view?usp=sharing) used for tech leads, and [here is the accompanying presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12SN5kqNuxI88wW4afONbc_7bMJ9abQNu/view?usp=sharing) explaining all the skills and scores
    - Note that the skills and technologies listed here were specific to a particular team and a particular project - you will want to add/remove items to suit your own needs.
        - (For Clare only) There are other versions (created for different purposes) available at `OneDrive\TW-Stuff\Clients\[Samba]\Development Programmes\Final`
        - (For Clare only) - the above drive location also contains a doc, `Summary Overall.docx`, which contains copies of introductory emails sent out with the skills matrix.
    - Note also that this version uses a spider diagram, but actually spider diagrams (aka radar charts) are not a good way of presenting information. [This article explains why](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2011/09/23/a-critique-of-radar-charts.html). Incidentallly, [this is also a good read on data visualisation]((https://blog.funnel.io/why-we-dont-use-pie-charts-and-some-tips-on-better-data-visualizations)) - in this case arguing against using pie charts.
- [Here is an example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sGyyOeFg4xl58WLq8bBuOmdrruLAcCE7/view?usp=sharing) of a spreadsheet listing competencies required by a BA (Business Analyst)
    - (For Clare only) There is more info on BA roles and competencies at `OneDrive\TW-Stuff\Clients\[Samba]\Development Programmes`.
