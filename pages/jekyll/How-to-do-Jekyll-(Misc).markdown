## Draft Posts

* Draft posts go in the _drafts folder, but apart from that they work the same as posts.  
* If you want to preview them, run **jekyll serve --draft**.  
* Note that you don't have to use the same naming convention - draft posts don't need a date attached to their name.

## Serving multiple local Jekyll sites

The default port is 4000, but you can add --port nnnn after the jekyll serve command to serve a separate site on a separate port.

## Code Snippets

Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
