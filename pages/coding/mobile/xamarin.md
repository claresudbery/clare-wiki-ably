## GitHub Repos 

Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

- [SquareFill](https://github.com/claresudbery/SquareFill)
- [SquareFillXamarin (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/SquareFillXamarin)
    - I think this is probably defunct, but am sticking it here just in case it contains anything useful!
- [ios-app-experiments (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/ios-app-experiments)
    - Can't quite remember what this is, but seems to be me learning about making iOS games?
- [Menopaws](https://github.com/Menopaws/menopaws)
