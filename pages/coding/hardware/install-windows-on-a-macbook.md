It's useful if you want to play games via Steam etc.

To install Windows on a Macbook:

## 1. Bootcamp

- less processor intensive, because it works via dual boot - ie you restart your mac and choose a different boot option, and only have one OS running at a time
- cheaper, because you only have to buy Windows 10 (£99 in Feb 2021)
- more awkward - you have to restart your laptop to change OS
- more faff to install. There's a great guide, but there are a lot of steps and you need a separate browser open on a separate device to follow instructions and install at same time
- fixed disk size. You have to decide disk size in advance and it creates a new partition, so (I think) you then get reduced disk size in both OSes.
- Harder to share files between OSes. You would basically have to download files from the cloud for each separate OS. Each partition doesn't have access to the other one.

## 2. Parallels

- more processor intensive: will run a virtual machine hosted by OSX, so both OSes are running at once. But if you have 8Gb more of RAM ("memory" in About This Mac) you should be fine.
- more expensive - you have to buy Parallels (currently £80 in Feb '21) as well as Windows 10
- less awkward - you can easily switch between OSes
- easier to install - it's just another piece of software
- variable disk size - you can reconfigure at any time
- easier to share files between OSes.
