## Advice

- check out https://www.logicalincrements.com/ - the entry/modest tiers would give great performance on Rocket League, Fortnite, League of Legends etc. The CoD games maybe only on lower settings (Steve L)
- you can probably do less than a 2060 ... i think a 970ti was fine for witcher3 ... i was probably in the res up from 1080p also (John N)
    - My note: These numbers all represent screen resolution
    - If you play a game at a lower screen resolution then you will get a better FPS (which is Frames Per Second), and therefore a smoother visual animation experience ([see examples here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/what-is-fps-and-how-it-helps-you-win-games/#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20FPS%20is%20the,display%20shows%20those%20completed%20frames.)).
    - More on resolution (it seems that 1080p is ample for now): https://uk.pcmag.com/graphic-cards/94896/the-best-graphics-cards-for-1080p-gaming-in-2020
- you can use a cheap as shit case if you want ... then you can start trimming specs. That pc had 16gb ... you could start with 8 see how it is ... just 1 8gig stick and plan to buy another if its bad. shopa bout for value motherboards etc. (John N)

- i would up the ssd to 0.5tb and make sure all games are installed on that any other crap can go on the hdd (including windows imo) (+Â£60)
- thats not going to play your AAA games or be super sexy,  but if you turn detail down on everything its probably goign to be very playable
- That logical increments site is cool and the builds seem reasonable. I second Steve's recommendation that the modest tier would be easily capable of a great experience in the listed titles at 1080p. Decent upgrade path too.

- Monitor: You need FreeSync for an AMD graphics card (eg Radeon) and G-Sync for an Nvidia card.
