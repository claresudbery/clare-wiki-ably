## Piano Man harmonica tutorial

- Piano Man: https://youtu.be/0BsiyZcWNOM?si=kviRMHo3pnEfVjJQ
- Lip locking / single notes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4mDMJzsnoU
  - Tongue-blocking is another way to play single notes, but is advanced and is not the quickest and easiest way of doing it
  - Another one is the pucker technique: Do NOT do this!
- Deep relaxed mouth position: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a_aXi1q8oY
  - This is actually covered in the lip-locking video linked to above
  - 1. Hold with numbdrs facing upwards, pinching just the end with one hand
  - 2. Moisten and relax lips
  - 3. Rotate harmonica so its back is pointing upwards and its front is pointing down into the moist inside of your bottom lip
  - 4. Make sure your upper lip extends right over the top of the harmonica, as far to the back of it as possible
    - Both lips should have their moist inner parts touching the silver plates of the harmonica
  - 5. Untuck the bottom lip with finger, so it's not folded under the instrument
