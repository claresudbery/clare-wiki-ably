## Clare singing

- [Here is a rough playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXjhYtWbEdI&list=PLNJwA3LE0_4FFJBRV57c-ECKdnN0Q6-pk). I don't have any decent recordings because I am a rank amateur! So the quality is patchy to say the least.
- The songs on the playlist are: 
  - *Molly the Bandit* - written by me, accompanied on the hoof (they'd never even seen the music before) by a fantastic band called Geriatric Jazz.
  - *Summertime* - @AllyFogg (my husband) on guitar, recorded on a phone in our garden.
  - *That ole Devil Called Love* (Billie Holiday / Alison Moyet) - me on piano, recorded on phone.
  - *Fever* (a la Peggy Lee (ish)) - Ally on guitar + we made our own backing track, using very basic technology. We decided the genre was "techno blues".
  - *Summertime* again - this time not soloing, just singing with a gospel choir. Recorded in a church, on phone, but lovely natural reverb from the building.
  - *How I Got Over* (Mahalia Jackson / Aretha Franklin) - backed by gospel choir. Recorded in church. No mic, so my voice is a bit strained in the second half when the backing singers pick up.
  - *Mamma Mia* (Abba) - Ally on guitar. An experimental slow version. Trying to pull each other back from the beat, which means we struggled to sync up. Recorded on phone.
  - *For You* (Eric Bibb) - Ally on guitar. Recorded at our wedding (so you get to see my amazing wedding dress - this is the only one with actual video footage). I was kind of distracted with, you know, getting married... so I don't think I did a brilliant job, but the context makes it moving.
