      - (itâ€™s for Windows so replace Ctrl with Cmd)

  - Ctrl + p / Cmd + P search for a file name (and also commands and
    other stuff I think)

  - Cmd + Shift + F - Find in files

  - Cmd + o - open a file (but it has to be recently opened or already
    open?)

  - Cmd + shift + o - search for a symbol

  - Select vertical column of text: 
    - Place the cursor where you want it
    - hold down Shift + Alt , then click and drag with the mouse

## Debugging

- If you want to debug code in VS Code, you need a `launch.json` file. 
- Click the Play button over on the left, and you'll see text saying something like "To customize Run and Debug create a launch.json file". If you click the link, it will create one for you.
- You might then want to add new configurations for new languages (eg Ruby) - to do that, click the link under "Show all automatic debug configurations"  and then click "Add configuration".
- If you're configuring debugging for Ruby, there are some extra instructions [here, under the link to Debugging Ruby with breakpoints](http://127.0.0.1:4000/pages/coding/lang/oo/Ruby#tutorials-and-guides)
