## Overview

Rider is an IntelliJ tool very much like Visual Studio

## Troubleshooting    

- In Rider when I accidentally click in gutter and open horrid window on left
  - right click in horrid area => close annotations

## Useful shortcuts

- Shift + Shift to search everywhere
- When working on remote machines, might need to change keymap:
  - Shift + Shift then type `keymap`
- Cmd + Shift + R brings up refactoring menu
- Option/Alt + Enter to bring up lightbulb menu ("intention actions")
