## Samba examples

There is some Samba-specific nuget stuff in [Samba Useful Notes](https://github.com/claresudbery/samba/blob/master/Useful-Notes.docx) (accessible to Clare only)

## Older NuGet stuff

There are some notes from LateRooms (I think) in my original UsefulNotes doc (currently in OneDrive/TW-Stuff/Organising/Notes)
