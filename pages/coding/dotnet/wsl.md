## Basics

- You can [install the Windows subsystem for linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install-win10)
    - !Warning!
    - Be aware that for many things WSL 2 is probably better (for instance if you want to run [node js](/pages/coding/webdev/js/Node-JS)), BUT in order to get this you have to enter the Windows Insider programme (or at least you do at the time of writing this, which is April 2020), which will mean that your operating system will be potentially unstable.
    - It's not recommended to have Windows Insider on your main machine
    - Instead, create a VM and run Windows Insider there - [follow the instructions here](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-virtual-machine-using-hyper-v-test-windows-10-insider-builds).
        - Note that if you can't get to Hyper-V Manager from the Start menu, go to Windows Administrative Tools and you'll find it in there.
