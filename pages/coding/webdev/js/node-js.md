- [Top 10 VS Code extensions for Node js](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/05/08/top-vs-code-extensions-for-nodejs-developers)

- You'll need [WSL 2](/pages/coding/dotnet/Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux---WSL), which you're [better off running in a VM](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-virtual-machine-using-hyper-v-test-windows-10-insider-builds) as long as it's still part of the Insider programme.
- Then follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-wsl2).
