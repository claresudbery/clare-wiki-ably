## What is Express?

- Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.
- Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love.
