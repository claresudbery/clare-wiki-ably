## Google Analytics

- In a jekyll site (including this one!). [See instructions here](https://desiredpersona.com/google-analytics-jekyll/).
    - There's one more step needed for this to work though - you need to make sure you're setting the Jekyll environment to production. See [this article](https://ajaykarwal.com/deploying-jekyll-using-travis-ci) for how to do that with Travis.
    - See commits [d993947](https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-wiki-ably/commit/d993947), [623b636](https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-wiki-ably/commit/623b636) and [f440af1](https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-wiki-ably/commit/f440af1) for when I set everything up on this site.
- Elsewhere: Google Analytics are used by Cadogan. I don't think my notes are worth copying over here, but they're all available (to Clare only) in [the following file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2_y20xOTQvJEW79Yl60t3L9mGGziUac_hda3mIBhg8/edit).
