## GitHub Repos

Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

- [RefactoringExamples (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/RefactoringExamples)
    - The original markdown for my series of refactoring articles that are being published on Martin Fowler's site. Contains some [useful notes about basic markdown rules and capabilities](https://github.com/claresudbery/RefactoringExamples/tree/master/github-markdown/example%20markdown).
- The repo for this website wot you are looking at right now: [clare-wiki-ably](https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-wiki-ably)
- The repo I created when I was experimenting with creating a vanilla Jekyll site: [clare-wiki-jekyll](https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-wiki-jekyll)

- RefactoringExamples: I created various useful scripts when I did the first markdown version of my [Martin Fowler refactoring article](/pages/think/code-princ/Refactoring). They're all documented in my [RefactoringExamples repo](https://github.com/claresudbery/RefactoringExamples/blob/master/github-markdown/notes/code-changes.md) (private only, I'm afraid).
  - That repo also contains some [useful notes about basic markdown rules and capabilities](https://github.com/claresudbery/RefactoringExamples/tree/master/github-markdown/example%20markdown).

## New notes

### Display triple backticks in a code block

To display triple backticks in a fenced code block, wrap them inside quadruple backticks.

Like this:

````js
````
```
You can see my triple backticks!
(Note: In order for you to see my quadruple backticks as well, in my markdown I wrapped my quadruple backticks in yet anopther set of quadruple backticks)
```
