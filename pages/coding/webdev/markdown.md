## GitHub Repos

Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

- [RefactoringExamples (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/RefactoringExamples)
    - The original markdown for my series of refactoring articles that are being published on Martin Fowler's site. Contains some [useful notes about basic markdown rules and capabilities](https://github.com/claresudbery/RefactoringExamples/tree/master/github-markdown/example%20markdown).
- The repo for this website wot you are looking at right now: [clare-wiki-ably](https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-wiki-ably)
- The repo I created when I was experimenting with creating a vanilla Jekyll site: [clare-wiki-jekyll](https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-wiki-jekyll)
