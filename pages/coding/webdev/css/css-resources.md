## GitHub Repos 

Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

- [codefirstgirls-bootstrap-exercise](https://github.com/claresudbery/codefirstgirls-bootstrap-exercise)

## Misc

- [CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator)
- Styleguide example: Search for "style guide" in [Samba Useful Notes](https://github.com/claresudbery/samba/blob/master/Useful-Notes.docx) (accessible to clare only)

## Css Specificity (how css is prioritised)

- There's a css section in UsefulNotes.docx (available to Clare only - TW-Stuff/Organising/Notes), but all the notes came from these two articles:
- [Specifics on css Specificity](http://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/)
- [Specificity - Things you should know](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/27/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/)

## Inspecting css in the browser

Use Chrome Dev Tools and find the styles section:

To see that box view over on the right, click the "Show computed styles" button over on the right:
