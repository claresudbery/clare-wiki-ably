## Defining targets

  - “targets” are commands that you have created in makefile
  - Makefile: when defining targets, the first line lists the
    dependencies (ie the things which will be run as part of the
    commend, or before the command). The next line defines the actual
    new command(s) to be run, with parameters (possibly separated by
    slash)

## Creating your own makefile commands

  - See
    [here](https://d.docs.live.net/pages/coding/tools/testing/Nightwatch#creating-your-own-makefile-commands-to-run-nightwatch-tests).
