## DORA State of DevOps 2019

- [DORA State of DevOps report 2019 (accessible to Clare only)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ul3snv4o7b0AxAWPfdwzH5HylvWdsW76/view?usp=sharing) - you can [download your own copy here](https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/)
- I saw a great presentation about this by [Tito Sarrionandia](https://twitter.com/rbs_tito) (slides available to Clare only [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W_zNVG0Pig3zryaWfCE66qvAzzm9ZtDJ/edit#slide=id.p1)) where he talked about four key metrics:
    - Deployment frequency 
    - Lead time
    - Time to restore
    - Change failure rate
- He made the following points:
    - Those four measurable areas are not tradeoffs
    - They represent measures of speed and of stability - they correlate highly with each other
    - Organisations moving faster, are typically breaking less.
    - There is no evidence that organisations are able to optimise one of those things by trading off the others. High performers score highly across the board in all four metrics, low performers score badly across the board.
