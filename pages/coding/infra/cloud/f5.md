  - Navigating F5:
    
      - You might have a front url and want to know what instances it’s
        being load-balanced across, or you might have an instance and
        want to know which load-balanced pool it’s in. Scroll down if
        you’re starting from an instance.
    
      - IF YOU HAVE A URL:
        
          - If you have a url and you want to know whether it’s load
            balanced behind the scenes:
        
          - For instance, <http://graphitegcp.acmecorp.com/>
        
          - First run **dig graphitegcp.acmecorp.com**
            
              - If it’s just a CNAME pointing to another DNS, do the
                same on the new DNS
            
              - (If that DNS is an internal one though, eg
                eventinator01.ab2.acme.com, then your trail has run cold
                and you know this url is NOT load balanced)
        
          - The **dig** command tells you that
            **graphitegcp.acmecorp.com** is pointing at **10.96.253.55**
        
          - So we go to F5 and select Local Traffic | Virtual Servers on
            the left. Then we search for **10.96.253.55**
        
          - This takes us to a vip (aka virtual server) called
            **vip\_gcp\_graphite-frontrelay\_0**
        
          - Click through to the vip and click on the Resources tab -
            this tells you that the default pool is
            **pool\_gcp\_carbonrelay\_2003**
            
              - NB: More than one vip can use the same pool
        
          - Select pools on the left and search for that pool
            (**pool\_gcp\_carbonrelay\_2003**) - click through
        
          - Select the Members tab for the pool, and you’ll see which
            instances are in that pool
        
          - Basically the VIP is the front door - people hitting that IP
            address will actually get their requests load-balanced
            across all the nodes in the pool
    
      - IF YOU HAVE AN INSTANCE:
        
          - If you have an instance and want to know what pool it’s in:
        
          - Scroll down to Nodes on the left, and search for either the
            IP address or the DNS of your instance
