## GitHub Repos 

Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

- [https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-wiki-ably](https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-wiki-ably)
    - The code for this site, which is built in Jekyll, which is built in Ruby.
- [https://github.com/claresudbery/clare-wiki-jekyll](https://github.com/claresudbery/Infra-Scripts)
    - Skeleton Jekyll site which I created before I started using the Ably template (Jekyll is built in Ruby).
