## GitHub Repos 

Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

- [data-engineering (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/data-engineering.git)
    - Stuff learnt / played with during TW data engineering course.
- [scala-test-001 (PRIVATE)](https://github.com/claresudbery/scala-test-001)
    - Can't quite remember what this is! Presumably me playing with Scala.
