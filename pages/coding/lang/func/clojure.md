## GitHub Repos 

Sadly by necessity some of my repos are private. Those that are private are clearly marked. For those that are, please don't ask me to share the code, because I can't. They're listed here purely for my reference.

- [clojure-playground](https://github.com/claresudbery/clojure-playground)
    - lots of useful notes in here, for instance all the different “playground” Clojure files in the [src/clojure-playground folder](https://github.com/claresudbery/clojure-playground/tree/master/src/clojure_playground).
- [clojure-stuff](https://github.com/claresudbery/clojure-stuff)
    - lots of useful notes in here, for instance walk.clj and walk2.clj in the [clojurebridge_turtle folder](https://github.com/claresudbery/clojure-stuff/tree/master/welcometoclojurebridge/src/clojurebridge_turtle).
