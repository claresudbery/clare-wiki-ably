When I had problems running jekyll on command line (GitBash, Windows) after installing jekyll using gem install jekyll bundler:
	Updated ruby version in .ruby-version
	Ran bundle install
	Then prefixed all jekyll commands with bundle exec - eg bundle exec jekyll -v and bundle exec jekyll build

Jekyll installation for windows: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/
	First I installed the Windows subsystem for linux: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install-win10
	Then I basically ran all the following commands (see below for some of the explanation):
		sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
		sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
		sudo apt-get install libgdbm-dev
		sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
		sudo apt-add-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng
		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install ruby2.5 ruby2.5-dev build-essential dh-autoreconf
		sudo chown -R claresudbery /var/lib/gems/2.5.0/
		sudo chown -R claresudbery /usr/local/bin
			(!! Those sudo chown commands are to get round the permissions errors you get otherwise when you run the next command (gem update))
		gem update
		gem install jekyll bundler

	When I followed the jekyll instructions, I got the following errors when I ran sudo gem update (immediately after sudo apt-get install ruby2.5 ruby2.5-dev build-essential dh-autoreconf):
		ERROR:  Error installing dbm: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension. checking for -lgdbm... no
		ERROR:  Error installing gdbm: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension. checking for gdbm_open() in -lgdbm... no
		ERROR:  Error installing zlib: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

			checking for deflateReset() in -lzlib1... no
			checking for deflateReset() in -lzlib... no
			checking for deflateReset() in -lzdll... no
			checking for deflateReset() in -lzlibwapi... no
		They were all followed by the following:
			extconf.rb failed
			Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary libraries and/or headers.  
			Check the mkmf.log file for more details.  You may need configuration options.
		The mkmf.log files were available here: 
			/var/lib/gems/2.5.0/extensions/x86_64-linux/2.5.0/dbm-1.1.0/mkmf.log
			/var/lib/gems/2.5.0/extensions/x86_64-linux/2.5.0/gdbm-2.1.0/mkmf.log
			/var/lib/gems/2.5.0/extensions/x86_64-linux/2.5.0/zlib-1.1.0/mkmf.log
		I found this article for a similar problem: https://github.com/zendesk/zendesk_apps_tools/issues/245
			Based on that and a bit of deduction / experimentation, I ran these lines:
				sudo apt-get install libgdbm-dev
				sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
			Then I ran sudo gem update again and all was good.
